# Campaign Detail Page & Related Features - Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the improvements and changes made to the campaign detail page (`/campaigns/[campaignId]`) and related components/systems during the pair programming session. The primary goal was to elevate the UI/UX to a higher standard and ensure consistency (SSOT) across functionalities.

## 1. Campaign Detail Page UI/UX Overhaul (Target: 6/10 -> 10/10) [DONE]

- **Layout & Spacing:** Increased padding between major sections and standardized spacing within cards for better visual flow and breathing room. Subtle background tints were considered for section separation.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Enhanced hierarchy through improved typography (contrast, font-weights, letter-spacing) and section dividers.
- **Card Design:** Refined card appearance with subtler shadows and added hover state micro-interactions (scale/border shifts).
- **Header Section:** Redesigned for better visual prominence of campaign name/status, using a distinct background/border and improved action button styling (shadows, hover states).
- **DataItem Component:** Standardized the display of individual data points within cards.
- **Empty/Loading States:** Enhanced skeleton loading states and improved designs for empty content sections (e.g., asset list, contacts).
- **Assets Display:** Improved grid layout and added hover effects for asset cards. Linked the "Upload Assets" button in the empty state to Step 4 of the wizard.

## 2. Icon System Management & Updates [DONE]

- **Icon Corrections:**
  - Fixed the "Campaign Details" card title icon to use `faClipboardLight`.
  - Updated the "Influencers" card title icon to use `faUsersLight`.
  - Identified and discussed the visual discrepancy in the downloaded `faClipboardLight.svg` (contained an unexpected solid circle element due to library rendering). The solution involves replacing the SVG content manually.
- **New Icons Added:**
  - Added `faClipboardLight` to `light-icon-registry.json`.
  - Added `faClipboardSolid` and `faUsersSolid` to `solid-icon-registry.json`.
  - Successfully downloaded the corresponding SVG files using the provided scripts (`download-light-icons.mjs`, `download-solid-icons.mjs`).
- **Registry Management:**
  - Removed placeholder "Example" icons from `new-*-icon-registry.json` files.
  - Merged the newly added icons from the `new-*-icon-registry.json` files into the main `light-icon-registry.json` and `solid-icon-registry.json`.
  - Fixed a JSON syntax error (missing comma) in `light-icon-registry.json`.
  - Regenerated the consolidated `src/lib/generated/icon-registry.ts` module using `generate-registry-module.mjs` after fixes.
  - Locked and unlocked registry files using the provided shell scripts (`lock-registry-files.sh`, `unlock-registry-files.sh`) and manual commands to ensure they could be edited and then secured again.

## 3. Toast Notification System (SSOT Standardization)

- **Identified Conflict:** Recognized the coexistence of two toast systems: Shadcn UI (`useToast`/`<Toaster>`) and `react-hot-toast` (`toast`/`<HotToaster>`).
- **Determined SSOT:** Confirmed that the working Campaign Wizard steps used `react-hot-toast` calls, establishing it as the intended SSOT for triggering toasts.
- **Centralized Rendering/Styling:** Configured the `<HotToaster>` component (from `react-hot-toast`) in the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) as the SSOT for _appearance_:
  - Set position to `top-center`.
  - Defined default `toastOptions` for consistent styling (borders, icons like `faFloppyDiskLight` for success, `faTriangleExclamationLight` for error).
  - Set default duration (5s) and specific duration for success (3s).
- **Code Standardization:**
  - Refactored the campaign detail page (`/[campaignId]/page.tsx`) to exclusively use `react-hot-toast` functions (`toast.success`, `toast.error`, etc.).
  - Removed the unused Shadcn UI `<Toaster>` component from `layout.tsx`.
- **Toast Behavior:**
  - Ensured loading toasts (`toast.loading`) are correctly dismissed using their IDs in all code paths (success/error).
  - Implemented custom JSX overrides for specific toasts (duplicate success, delete success) to display unique icons (`faCopyLight`, `faTrashCanSolid`) and messages while leveraging the global positioning and base styling.

## 4. Duplicate Campaign Functionality (SSOT & Refactoring)

- **Initial Reusable Component:** Created `DuplicateCampaignButton.tsx` (initially in `features/campaigns/`, later moved to `ui/`) encapsulating the dialog, state, and API logic.
- **Integration:** Integrated the reusable button into the campaign detail page.
- **Reversion on List Page:** Reverted the `/campaigns` list page back to using an `IconButtonAction` with its own internal duplication logic (state, dialog, API call) to maintain visual consistency with other actions on _that specific page_. The reusable component remains available.
- **Payload Correction:** Fixed issues in the duplication payload construction (mapping `budget.social`, handling contacts/assets correctly, ensuring necessary fields like `brand` were included).
- **Duplicate Name Pre-Check:** Added an API call (`checkCampaignNameExists`) within the duplication logic (both in the reusable component and the list page's internal handler) to check for existing names _before_ attempting creation, improving UX.

## 5. Delete Campaign Functionality (SSOT & Enhancement)

- **Enhanced Confirmation:** Implemented a mandatory confirmation step requiring the user to type "DELETE".
- **Reusable Component:** Created `ConfirmDeleteDialog` (`src/components/ui/dialog-confirm-delete.tsx`) to encapsulate this enhanced confirmation logic (input validation, pending state, callbacks).
- **Integration:**
  - Refactored the campaign detail page (`/[campaignId]/page.tsx`) to remove its specific delete dialog and use `<ConfirmDeleteDialog />`.
  - Refactored the campaigns list page (`/campaigns/page.tsx`) to also remove its simple dialog and use `<ConfirmDeleteDialog />`, ensuring consistent delete behavior across the app.
- **Toast:** Ensured the delete success toast uses the correct custom styling (red border, trash icon).

## 6. Download All Assets Functionality [DONE]

- **Implementation:** Installed `jszip` and `file-saver` libraries.
- **Functionality:** Implemented client-side asset fetching, zipping using JSZip, and triggering a download of the zip archive via `saveAs`.
- **Feedback:** Added loading and success/error toasts using `react-hot-toast`. Corrected an issue where the browser initially misinterpreted the zip file by ensuring the blob type was correctly handled by `saveAs`.
- **Message Refinement:** Updated the success toast message to be more generic ("Assets downloaded successfully!") instead of counting assets.

## 7. Duplicate Campaign Name Validation (Holistic Approach)

- **Backend Requirement:** Defined the need for a backend API endpoint (`GET /api/campaigns/check-name`) to definitively check name uniqueness per user.
- **Frontend Validation (Zod):** Re-added an asynchronous `.refine` check to the central `DraftCampaignDataSchema` in `types.ts` to call the `checkCampaignNameExists` helper, providing validation within the wizard form.
- **Debouncing:** Added TODO comments in `Step1Content.tsx` outlining the need and method for debouncing the name input to prevent excessive API calls during the async validation.

## 8. Error Resolution & Debugging

- Fixed JSON syntax error in `light-icon-registry.json`.
- Resolved "Module not found" errors related to incorrect `useToast` and `DuplicateCampaignButton` import paths.
- Corrected multiple TypeScript type errors during refactoring (e.g., `id`, `email`, `position`, `audience` mismatches between components).
- Addressed build errors (`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'entryCSSFiles')`) by simplifying toast options in the layout.
- Diagnosed API 404 errors after deletion as expected behavior.
- Identified non-JSON API responses during duplication as a backend issue requiring correction.
- Fixed linter errors related to variable scope and declarations after refactoring.
