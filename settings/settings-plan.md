# Settings Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the Settings section of The Write Company application. Based on the design mockups, we'll implement three main settings pages:

1. Profile Settings
2. Team Management
3. Branding

## Production Requirements

> **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** The settings implementation MUST be production-ready and fully integrated with our database and Auth0 authentication system.

### Database Integration
- All settings changes must persist to our database
- Data modifications must be atomic and transactional where appropriate
- Database queries must be optimized for performance
- Proper error handling for database operations
- Follow existing data access patterns in the codebase

### Auth0 Integration
- All settings pages must respect Auth0 authentication
- User profile information should be synchronized with Auth0 where applicable
- Permission changes must be reflected in Auth0 roles/permissions
- Secure handling of Auth0 tokens and session management
- Follow security best practices for Auth0 implementation

### Production Readiness Checklist
- ✅ Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ✅ Security auditing
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Accessibility compliance
- ✅ Documentation

## Tech Stack & Architecture
- Next.js for frontend framework
- React for UI components
- TypeScript for type safety
- TailwindCSS for styling
- FontAwesome Pro for icons (fa-light default, fa-solid on hover)
- Framer Motion for animations
- RESTful API integration for data operations
- **Auth0** for authentication and authorization (via `@auth0/nextjs-auth0` package)
- **PostgreSQL** database with Prisma ORM for data persistence

## Existing Database Models (Identified in Codebase)

Our settings pages will utilize the following existing Prisma models:

```prisma
// User model with Auth0 integration
model User {
  id               String      @id
  auth0Id          String      @unique  // Auth0 identifier
  email            String      @unique
  firstName        String?     
  surname          String?     
  companyName      String?     
  profilePictureUrl String?     
  createdAt        DateTime    @default(now())
  updatedAt        DateTime    
  
  // Relationships
  notificationPrefs NotificationPrefs?
  teamMemberships   TeamMember[]
}

// Notification preferences
model NotificationPrefs {
  id                     Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId                 String  @unique
  campaignUpdates        Boolean @default(false)
  brandHealthAlerts      Boolean @default(false)
  aiInsightNotifications Boolean @default(false)
  user                   User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}

// Team management models
model TeamMember {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  ownerId   String
  memberId  String
  role      TeamRole @default(MEMBER)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  member    User     @relation("TeamMember", fields: [memberId], references: [id])
  owner     User     @relation("TeamOwner", fields: [ownerId], references: [id])
}

model TeamInvitation {
  id        String           @id @default(uuid())
  email     String
  status    InvitationStatus @default(PENDING)
  inviterId String
  inviteeId String?
  role      TeamRole         @default(MEMBER)
  createdAt DateTime         @default(now())
  expiresAt DateTime
  invitee   User?            @relation("InvitationReceiver", fields: [inviteeId], references: [id])
  inviter   User             @relation("InvitationSender", fields: [inviterId], references: [id])
}

// Branding settings
model BrandingSettings {
  id             String   @id @default(uuid())
  companyId      String   @unique
  primaryColor   String
  secondaryColor String
  headerFont     String
  headerFontSize String
  bodyFont       String
  bodyFontSize   String
  logoUrl        String?
  createdAt      DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt      DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

## Existing Auth0 Integration (Identified in Codebase)

The application already has Auth0 integration set up with the following components:

- `src/lib/auth.ts` - Auth0 SDK initialization with Next.js
- `src/app/api/auth/[auth0]/route.ts` - Auth0 API routes for login/logout
- `src/lib/session.ts` - Session handling with Auth0
- `@auth0/nextjs-auth0` - Main Auth0 package used for integration

Our settings implementation will leverage these existing components.

## Brand Colors
- Primary: Jet #333333
- Secondary: Payne's Grey #4A5568
- Accent: Deep Sky Blue #00BFFF
- Background: White #FFFFFF
- Divider: French Grey #D1D5DB
- Interactive: Medium Blue #3182CE

## Component Architecture

              └── logo/
                  └── route.ts          # POST logo upload
```

## Integration with Existing Codebase

To ensure proper integration with the rest of the application:

1. UI Components: We will leverage the existing UI components found in `src/components/ui/` for consistent styling.

2. API Integration: We will follow the existing API convention patterns used in other parts of the application.

3. Navigation: We will integrate with the main app navigation structure to ensure settings pages are accessible from the main navigation.

4. Authentication: We will utilize the existing Auth0 authentication system (`src/lib/auth.ts`, `src/lib/session.ts`) for user verification and permission checks. **Must be production-ready and secure**.

5. Database: We will integrate with the existing PostgreSQL database system using Prisma ORM (`src/lib/db.ts`) for data persistence. **Must follow production database access patterns**.

6. FontAwesome Icons: Adhere to the app's icon convention using FontAwesome Pro with default 'fa-light' and hover 'fa-solid' states. ✅ (Implemented)

      └── db.ts                     # Database utilities ✅ (Existing)
```

This structure provides several benefits:

1. **Centralized Components**: All settings-related components are now centralized in `src/components/settings/`, promoting reusability and discoverability.

2. **Feature Separation**: Components are organized by feature (shared, profile, team-management, branding), making it easier to locate and maintain related code.

3. **Clear Route Structure**: The Next.js app router routes are kept clean with just the page components, while implementation details are moved to the components directory.

4. **Scalability**: This architecture scales well as more features are added, with a clear pattern for where new components should be placed.

5. **Cross-Feature Reuse**: Shared components can be easily reused across different settings pages, reducing duplication.

```

This structure provides several benefits:

1. **Centralized Components**: All settings-related components are now centralized in `src/components/settings/`, promoting reusability and discoverability.

2. **Feature Separation**: Components are organized by feature (shared, profile, team-management, branding), making it easier to locate and maintain related code.

3. **Clear Route Structure**: The Next.js app router routes are kept clean with just the page components, while implementation details are moved to the components directory.

4. **Scalability**: This architecture scales well as more features are added, with a clear pattern for where new components should be placed.

5. **Cross-Feature Reuse**: Shared components can be easily reused across different settings pages, reducing duplication.

## Main Page Implementation Status

To ensure our settings pages render properly and provide a great user experience, we've implemented the following enhancements:

### Team Management Page ✅ (Fully Implemented)

### Implementation Patterns

We've established consistent patterns across both pages:

1. **Component Structure**
   - Each logical section has its own component
   - Components handle their own state and validation
   - Shared UI elements are reused across sections
   - Clear separation of concerns between components

2. **Data Flow**
   - Top-level pages manage data fetching and state
   - Data is passed to child components as props
   - Components communicate changes via callbacks
   - Success/error handling is consistent across the app

3. **UI States**
   - Loading: Shows skeleton components during data fetching
   - Error: Displays user-friendly error messages with retry options
   - Empty: Handles cases when no data is available
   - Success: Provides feedback on successful actions
   - Changed: Tracks form changes and enables save/cancel actions

4. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Pages work without JavaScript for basic content viewing
   - Enhanced with React for interactive elements
   - Animated transitions for improved UX
   - Accessibility considerations at all levels

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

These aspects are consistently implemented across all settings pages:

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Conditional rendering to avoid unnecessary work
   - State tracking to prevent needless re-renders
   - Skeleton UI to improve perceived performance
   - Optimistic UI updates for faster feedback

2. **Error Handling**
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Clear recovery paths (retry, refresh)
   - Granular error handling at component level
   - Console logging in development for debugging

3. **Accessibility**
   - Semantic HTML structure
   - Proper ARIA attributes
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Focus management for modals and alerts

4. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Fluid layouts that adapt to screen size
   - Optimized touch targets for mobile users
   - Simplified layouts on smaller screens
   - Consistent experience across devices

This implementation strategy ensures our settings pages not only look great but also provide a smooth, intuitive user experience with proper error handling, loading states, and accessibility considerations.

## Debugging Tools and Implementation

To facilitate development and troubleshooting, we have implemented dedicated debug pages that serve as controlled environments for testing components and identifying rendering issues. These pages are particularly valuable when diagnosing complex components or when standard pages show unexpected behavior.

### Debug Pages

We've created the following debug pages:

1. **Team Management Debug Page** ✅ (Implemented)
   - Route: `/settings/team-management/debug`
   - Purpose: Tests rendering of `DebugCard` and `MembersListDebug` components
   - Features:
     - Interactive counter to verify state management
     - Simplified member list with mock data
     - Multiple card instances to test layout
   - Implementation: Uses the simplified `DebugCard` component to isolate UI issues

2. **Simple Debug Page** ✅ (Implemented)
   - Route: `/settings/team-management/simple-debug`
   - Purpose: Minimal implementation with no dependencies beyond React
   - Features:
     - Increment/reset counter for testing React state
     - Runtime information display (time, window width)
     - React loading confirmation
     - Console logging capability
   - Implementation: Uses only native HTML elements and minimal styling to isolate React functionality

3. **Fixed Team Management Page** ✅ (Implemented)
   - Route: `/settings/team-management/fixed`
   - Purpose: Alternative implementation of team management for debugging
   - Features:
     - Simplified data loading with mock data
     - Debug controls for viewing and manipulating state
     - Isolated from API dependencies
   - Implementation: Uses `DebugWrapper` to provide visual indicators and state logging

### Debug Components

These specialized components help isolate and diagnose rendering issues:

1. **DebugCard** ✅ (Implemented)
   - Purpose: Simplified version of the Card component for debugging
   - Features: 
     - Minimal styling with clear visual boundaries
     - Title prop to clearly identify card contents
     - Removes complex styling that might cause issues

2. **DebugWrapper** ✅ (Implemented)
   - Purpose: Wrapper component to provide debugging context
   - Features:
     - Visual indicators with distinct colors for easy identification
     - State information display
     - Console logging capability for component data
     - Child count display

3. **MembersListDebug** ✅ (Implemented)
   - Purpose: Simplified version of MembersList for debugging
   - Features:
     - Uses static mock data instead of API calls
     - Simplified rendering without complex interactions
     - Clear structure for testing table layouts

### Debugging Strategy

When troubleshooting issues in the settings pages, we follow this approach:

1. **Isolate the problem**: Use the debug pages to determine if issues are related to specific components, data loading, or API integration.

2. **Verify basic rendering**: The simple-debug page confirms that basic React functionality is working correctly.

3. **Test specific components**: The team-management/debug page tests specific components in isolation.

4. **Compare implementations**: Use the fixed implementation to identify differences that might be causing issues.

5. **Inspect console output**: All debug pages include options to log state information to the console.

These debugging tools are essential for maintaining a robust implementation, especially when working with complex features like team management that involve data fetching, state management, and conditional rendering.

### Next.js App Router Considerations

Our debugging implementation follows Next.js App Router conventions:

- All routes are implemented using the directory-based structure (`/route-name/page.tsx`)
- Client components are properly marked with `'use client'` directive
- Each debug page is self-contained to avoid dependencies on shared state
- Debug tools are excluded from production builds
