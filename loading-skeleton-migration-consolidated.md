# Loading Skeleton Migration - Consolidated

## Overview

This document tracks the migration from basic `LoadingSpinner` components to more advanced content placeholders using `LoadingSkeleton` components, following the pattern used in the Campaign Details page. This migration will create a more unified and visually appealing loading experience.

## Current State

- **LoadingSpinner**: Basic animated spinner used in 20+ locations across the app
- **LoadingSkeleton**: Advanced content placeholder used primarily in Campaign Details page (`src/components/LoadingSkeleton/index.tsx`)
- **Authentication Spinner**: Custom spinner with "Checking authentication..." text in `src/components/layouts/client-layout.tsx`
- **Various Debug Spinners**: Several spinner implementations in debug tools
- **UI Components Library**: Contains multiple spinner and skeleton variants in `src/components/ui/examples.tsx`
- **Inconsistency**: Different loading patterns create visual inconsistency and less polished user experience

## Migration Status

### Campaign Details Pages
- [x] Campaign Details (`/campaigns/[id]`) - Updated to use global skeleton components:
  - [x] Enhanced with dedicated `loading.tsx` file for Next.js App Router SSR loading state using `SkeletonSection` components
  - [x] Improved inline loading state in the client component with composition of `SkeletonSection` components for data fetching
  - [x] Removed specialized `CampaignDetailSkeleton` in favor of global skeleton components

### Campaign List Pages
- [x] Campaign List (`/campaigns`) - Updated to use global skeleton components:
  - [x] Created dedicated `loading.tsx` file for Next.js App Router SSR loading state using `TableSkeleton` component
  - [x] Enhanced client-side inline loading with `TableSkeleton` for both user and campaign loading states
  - [x] Implemented consistent loading UI with proper heading and table structure placeholders

### Wizard Pages
- [x] Step 1 - Using `WizardSkeleton` with step prop
  - [x] Updated dynamic imports with `WizardSkeleton` instead of `LoadingSpinner`
- [x] Step 2 - Using `WizardSkeleton` with step prop
  - [x] Updated dynamic imports with `WizardSkeleton` instead of `LoadingSpinner`
- [x] Step 3 - Using `WizardSkeleton` with step prop
  - [x] Updated dynamic imports with `WizardSkeleton` instead of `LoadingSpinner`
- [x] Step 4 - Using `WizardSkeleton` with step prop
  - [x] Added to `StepContentLoader` with appropriate `WizardSkeleton`
- [x] Step 5 - Using `WizardSkeleton` with step prop
  - [x] Added to `StepContentLoader` with appropriate `WizardSkeleton`

## Component Details

### LoadingSkeleton
The `LoadingSkeleton` is an advanced content placeholder primarily used in the Campaign Details page.

### WizardSkeleton
The `WizardSkeleton` is specialized for the Campaign Wizard and accepts a `step` prop to adjust the skeleton layout based on each wizard step's content structure.

### Enhanced Contextual Skeletons
The system has been expanded with more component types that precisely match the actual content:

- **FormFieldSkeleton**: Specialized field types (text, select, checkbox, radio, textarea, datepicker, upload)
- **SkeletonSection**: Reusable content sections with configurable headers and content
- **TableSkeleton**: Enhanced with filters, custom column widths, and configurable headers
- **FormSkeleton**: Supports different layouts, field types, and submit buttons
- **AuthSkeleton**: Different variants for sign-in, sign-up, or loading states
- **DashboardSkeleton**: Complete dashboard layout with stats, tables, and charts

## Implementation Notes
- `WizardSkeleton` design matches the layout of Campaign Details pages with rounded corners, shadows, and proper spacing
- Each step variant is styled appropriately for the specific content that will appear on that step
- Skeletons include appropriate placeholders for:
  - Headers
  - Progress bar
  - Form fields
  - Navigation buttons
- `WizardSkeleton` is now fully responsive with proper mobile and desktop styling using Tailwind's responsive modifiers
- Grid layouts properly adapt to different viewport sizes using responsive grid columns
- All skeleton components now accept extensive configuration options to precisely match content
- Step-specific content for wizard steps that accurately mirrors the actual components
- Component composition allows building complex, nested skeletons to match any page layout

## Next Steps

1. Update the remaining files to use the new import paths
2. Implement appropriate skeleton components in the high-visibility pages
3. Create PR for the authentication spinner updates
4. Update the server components to use the new loading skeletons
5. Enhance Next.js App Router pages with dedicated loading.tsx files:

   - [x] Campaign List Page - updated with server-side loading.tsx and client-side inline loading using TableSkeleton
   - [x] Dashboard Pages - updated with dedicated loading.tsx file and inline TableSkeleton components
   - [ ] Analytics Pages - need loading.tsx implementation
   - [ ] Settings Pages - need loading.tsx implementation

## Component Restructuring Details

All loading-related components have been consolidated into two dedicated directories:

### 1. Loading Skeletons (`src/components/ui/loading-skeleton/`)
- `skeleton.tsx` - Base skeleton component with variants (rectangular, circular, text, card)
- `index.tsx` - Specialized skeleton implementations:
  - `CampaignDetailSkeleton` - For campaign details page
  - `WizardSkeleton` - For wizard steps with contextual content for each step
  - `TableSkeleton` - For data tables with configurable columns and filters
  - `FormSkeleton` - For form inputs with multiple field type support
  - `AuthSkeleton` - For authentication flow with different variants
  - `DashboardSkeleton` - For dashboard layouts with stats and charts
  - `SkeletonSection` - Reusable content block with customizable structure
  - `FormFieldSkeleton` - Individual form field skeletons for different input types

### 2. Loading Spinners (`src/components/ui/spinner/`)
- `index.tsx` - Various spinner implementations:
  - `Spinner` - Configurable base spinner
  - `AuthSpinner` - For authentication pages
  - `ButtonSpinner` - For inline button loading
  - `FullscreenSpinner` - Modal spinner overlay
  - `InlineSpinner` - For inline text loading
  - `DotsSpinner` - Animated dots spinner

## UI Component Updates

The debug-tools UI Components page has been updated to provide a cleaner, more integrated experience:

- Removed tabbed interface in favor of a unified component display
- Fixed HTML nesting issues (replaced invalid `<p>` > `<div>` nesting with proper structure)
- Combined both spinner and skeleton examples into a cohesive Loading section
- Ensured proper display of all loading components
- Updated imports to reference components from their correct directories

## Implementation Strategy

The skeleton system follows these design principles:

1. **Composability**: Components can be nested and combined to create complex layouts
2. **Contextual accuracy**: Each skeleton mirrors the actual content it represents
3. **Configuration**: Extensive props allow fine-tuning appearance without custom code
4. **Responsiveness**: All components adapt properly to all screen sizes
5. **Reusability**: Common patterns extracted into reusable components
6. **Global consistency**: Unified styling across all loading states

### Component Usage Pattern

```tsx
// Basic usage
<WizardSkeleton step={3} />

// With custom configurations
<WizardSkeleton 
  step={3}
  hasProgressBar={true}
  hasHeader={true}
  maxWidth="max-w-5xl"
/>

// With completely custom content
<WizardSkeleton
  step={3}
  stepContent={
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <SkeletonSection title={true} lines={4} />
      <FormSkeleton 
        fields={3} 
        layout="grid" 
        fieldTypes={['text', 'select', 'textarea']} 
      />
    </div>
  }
/>
```

## Migration Strategy

### 1. Update Imports (Week 1)

Update all imports in the codebase to use the new component paths:

```tsx
// BEFORE
import LoadingSkeleton from '@/components/LoadingSkeleton';
// or
import { Skeleton } from '@/components/ui/skeleton';

// AFTER
import LoadingSkeleton from '@/components/ui/loading-skeleton';
// or
import { Skeleton } from '@/components/ui/loading-skeleton/skeleton';
// or
import { WizardSkeleton, TableSkeleton } from '@/components/ui/loading-skeleton';
```

For spinners:

```tsx
// BEFORE
// Various custom spinner implementations

// AFTER
import { Spinner } from '@/components/ui/spinner';
// or
import { AuthSpinner, ButtonSpinner } from '@/components/ui/spinner';
```

### 2. Authentication Spinner Update (Week 1)

Update the authentication loading state in `src/components/layouts/client-layout.tsx` to:
1. Replace spinner with the `AuthSpinner` component
2. Change text from "Checking authentication..." to "Loading Justify..."

```tsx
// BEFORE
return (
  <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
    <div className="text-center">
      <div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-12 w-12 border-t-2 border-b-2 border-gray-900 mx-auto"></div>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">Checking authentication...</p>
    </div>
  </div>
);

// AFTER
import { AuthSpinner } from '@/components/ui/spinner';

return (
  <AuthSpinner label="Loading Justify..." />
);
```

### 3. Prioritized Replacement (Weeks 2-3)

Replace LoadingSpinner instances with appropriate skeleton components in the following order:

1. High-visibility pages:
   - Campaign wizard steps (all 5 steps in `src/app/campaigns/wizard/step-*/`)
   - Dashboard page (`src/app/dashboard/`)
   - Campaign list page (`src/app/campaigns/`)

2. Secondary pages:
   - Submission pages (`src/app/campaigns/wizard/submission/`)
   - Form components (`src/components/forms/`)
   - Detail views (`src/app/campaigns/[id]/`)

3. Minor components:
   - Dialog boxes (`src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`)
   - Inline loaders (various locations)
   - Debug tools (`src/app/debug-tools/`)

### 4. Implementation Patterns

For each replacement:

```tsx
// BEFORE
if (loading) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />;
}

// AFTER
import { WizardSkeleton } from '@/components/ui/loading-skeleton';

if (loading) {
  return <WizardSkeleton step={currentStep} />;
}
```

For Suspense boundaries:

```tsx
// BEFORE
<Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
  <Component />
</Suspense>

// AFTER
import { WizardSkeleton } from '@/components/ui/loading-skeleton';

<Suspense fallback={<WizardSkeleton step={currentStep} />}>
  <Component />
</Suspense>
```

### 5. Server Components (Week 4)

Update React Server Components to use appropriate skeletons, found in files like:
- `src/app/campaigns/ServerCampaigns.tsx` 
- `src/app/campaigns/wizard/step-*/page.tsx`

```tsx
// BEFORE
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
      <ClientPage />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

// AFTER
import { WizardSkeleton } from '@/components/ui/loading-skeleton';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<WizardSkeleton step={2} />}>
      <ClientPage />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

### 6. Debug Tools Update (Week 4)

Update all loading states in the debug tools area to use the new skeletons:
- `src/app/debug-tools/ui-components/`
- `src/app/debug-tools/database/`
- `src/app/debug-tools/debug-step/`

This includes ensuring that the UI components debug page showcases all the skeleton loaders properly.
