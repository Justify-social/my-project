## Troubleshooting

### Performance Issues with Large Influencer Lists

**Symptom:** Slow loading or browser performance issues when viewing large lists of influencers

**Solution:** Ensure pagination settings are optimized. Reduce the number of influencers loaded per page in settings.

### Influencer Data Discrepancy

**Symptom:** Metrics shown don't match platform analytics

**Solution:** Check the last data sync timestamp. If data is outdated, manually trigger a refresh using the sync button.
