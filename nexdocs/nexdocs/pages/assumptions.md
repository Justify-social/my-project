**Last Updated:** 2025-03-05

This document lists all identified assumptions and inaccuracies found in the Campaign Wizard documentation. Each entry includes the file path, line number or section, the identified issue, and the potential impact on users or developers.

## Overview

Documentation accuracy is crucial for both users and developers. This document aims to:
1. Track all identified assumptions and inaccuracies
2. Provide context about why each item is problematic
3. Serve as a reference for documentation updates

## Identified Issues

### Repository Information

| File | Section/Line | Issue | Impact |
|------|--------------|-------|--------|
| `/docs/guides/developer/setup.md` | Line 16-17 | Incorrect repository URL: `git clone https://github.com/organization/campaign-wizard.git` | Developers will be unable to clone the repository |
| `/docs/guides/developer/setup.md` | Line 186 | Incorrect repository URL: `[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/organization/campaign-wizard)` | Developers will be directed to a non-existent repository |
| `/docs/guides/developer/setup.md` | Line 187 | Non-existent wiki reference: `[Internal Wiki](https://wiki.example.com)` | Developers will be directed to a non-existent wiki |

### Product and Company Naming

| File | Section/Line | Issue | Impact |
|------|--------------|-------|--------|
| Multiple files | Throughout | Inconsistent product naming: "Campaign Wizard" is used in most files (~101 occurrences) while "Justify" is mentioned in a few places (~3 occurrences) | Confusion about the actual product name |
| `/docs/guides/user/journey.md` | Line 1 | References "Justify platform" instead of "Campaign Wizard" | User confusion about product identity |
| `/docs/guides/user-journey.md` | Line 1 | References "Justify platform" instead of "Campaign Wizard" | User confusion about product identity |

### Technology Assumptions

| File | Section/Line | Issue | Impact |
|------|--------------|-------|--------|
| `/docs/guides/developer/setup.md` | Lines 8-14 | Assumes specific technology stack (Node.js, PostgreSQL) without verification | Development setup may fail if these are not the actual technologies used |
| `/docs/guides/developer/setup.md` | Line 51 | Assumes PostgreSQL database name of "campaign_wizard" | Setup process may fail if this is not the correct database name |
| `/docs/guides/developer/setup.md` | Lines 29-38 | Assumes specific environment variable structure | Development configuration may be incorrect |
| `/docs/features-frontend/README.md` | Lines 86-93 | Lists technical dependencies (React 18+, Next.js, TypeScript, etc.) without verification | Developers may rely on incorrect technology information |

### Date and Version Assumptions

| File | Section/Line | Issue | Impact |
|------|--------------|-------|--------|
| All files | "Last Updated" | All files use the date "2025-03-05" (51 occurrences) which appears to be artificially set | Confusion about when documentation was actually created or updated |
| `/docs/guides/developer/setup.md` | Lines 8-10 | Specifies version requirements (Node.js v16+, npm v7+, PostgreSQL v14+) without verification | Setup process may fail with incompatible versions |
| `/docs/features-backend/linting/overview.md` | Lines 38-39 | References specific GitHub Actions versions | CI/CD processes may fail if these versions are incompatible |

### API Endpoint and Environment Assumptions

| File | Section/Line | Issue | Impact |
|------|--------------|-------|--------|
| `/docs/guides/developer/setup.md` | Line 78 | Assumes the application runs on port 3000: `http://localhost:3000` | Development testing may fail if a different port is used |
| `/docs/features-backend/testing/strategy.md` | Line 18 | Assumes API base URL: `http://localhost:3000/api` | Testing may fail if the API is served at a different path |
| `/docs/features-backend/apis/overview.md` | Throughout | Lists many API endpoints without verification of their existence | API integration may fail |
| `/docs/features-backend/authentication/implementation.md` | Throughout | Assumes specific file structure and implementation details | Developers may be misled about actual implementation |

### Example Credentials and Data

| File | Section/Line | Issue | Impact |
|------|--------------|-------|--------|
| `/docs/guides/developer/setup.md` | Lines 163-164 | Provides test credentials: `test@example.com` / `test-password` | Security risk if these are actual credentials |
| Multiple files | Throughout | Uses `example.com` email addresses for examples | May cause confusion if actual domain is different |
| `/docs/features-backend/architecture/implementation-plan.md` | Lines 147-148 | Lists presumably fictional support email: `support@example.com` | Users may attempt to contact non-existent support |

### File Structure and Organization Assumptions

| File | Section/Line | Issue | Impact |
|------|--------------|-------|--------|
| `/docs/guides/developer/setup.md` | Lines 82-96 | Describes a specific code structure without verification | Developers may be confused when actual structure differs |
| `/docs/features-backend/authentication/implementation.md` | Lines 15-17 | References specific file paths like `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts` | Developers may look for files in the wrong location |
| `/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` | Lines 7-28 | Outlines a documentation structure that may not match reality | Contributors may organize documentation incorrectly |

### Other Assumptions

| File | Section/Line | Issue | Impact |
|------|--------------|-------|--------|
| Multiple files | Throughout | Creates comprehensive documentation for features that may not exist or may be different from described | Users and developers will be misled about available functionality |
| Newly created documentation | Throughout | Creates detailed usage guides without verification of actual user flows | Users may follow instructions that don't match the actual application |
| Campaign Wizard application | N/A | Documentation assumes this is a marketing campaign management application, which may not be accurate | Misleading information about the application's purpose and functionality |

## Conclusion

The documentation contains numerous inaccuracies and assumptions that could significantly impact its usability and reliability. Many of these issues arise from creating documentation without verifying the actual implementation or structure of the application. To improve the documentation quality, all identified issues should be addressed by referring to the actual codebase and application functionality.
