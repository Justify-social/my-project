Analyzing SafeFontAwesomeIcon component implementation:
[2025-03-20T17:51:22.821Z]   ⚠️ Missing critical checks in SafeFontAwesomeIcon:
[2025-03-20T17:51:22.821Z]   - Missing: Object.keys(icon).length === 0
[2025-03-20T17:51:22.821Z]   - Missing: JSON.stringify(icon) === '{}'

=== COMPREHENSIVE FIXES ===
[2025-03-20T17:51:22.829Z] 1. Replace your SafeFontAwesomeIcon component with the robust implementation
[2025-03-20T17:51:22.829Z] 2. Add the runtime debug script to your debug page
[2025-03-20T17:51:22.829Z] 3. Apply the icon validator utility for all icon operations
[2025-03-20T17:51:22.829Z] 4. Consider using the IconTester wrapper to catch errors
[2025-03-20T17:51:22.829Z] 
The most likely issue is that empty objects are bypassing validation in SafeFontAwesomeIcon.
[2025-03-20T17:51:22.829Z] Check for any places in the code where {} might be passed as an icon prop.
[2025-03-20T17:51:22.830Z] 
Most importantly, apply the robust implementation which has extra validation layers.
[2025-03-20T17:51:22.830Z] 
=== WHAT TO CHECK IN BROWSER ===
[2025-03-20T17:51:22.830Z] 1. Add console.log statements throughout the code to trace props
[2025-03-20T17:51:22.830Z] 2. Set breakpoints in the FontAwesomeIcon and SafeFontAwesomeIcon components
[2025-03-20T17:51:22.830Z] 3. Watch for React DevTools warnings about invalid props
