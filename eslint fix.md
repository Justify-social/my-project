# Analysis of ESLint Error: Plugin "@typescript-eslint" Not Found

## Observation

The build process presented the following ESLint error:

`Linting and checking validity of types ... тип ESLint: Key "rules": Key "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": Could not find plugin "@typescript-eslint" in configuration.`

This error indicates that ESLint, during its linting phase, attempted to apply a rule (`@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`) that is designated as belonging to a plugin named `@typescript-eslint`. However, ESLint was unable to locate or recognize this plugin within its current configuration.

## Root Cause Analysis

The core of the issue lies in ESLint's plugin resolution mechanism. For ESLint to utilize rules provided by a plugin (e.g., `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`, which provides rules namespaced under `@typescript-eslint`), two fundamental conditions must be met:

1.  **Plugin Installation**: The necessary npm package for the plugin (in this case, primarily `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and its peer dependency `@typescript-eslint/parser`) must be installed within the project's `node_modules` directory.

    - _Codebase Check_: The `package.json` confirms `devDependencies` include `"@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "^8.32.1"` and `"@typescript-eslint/parser": "^8.32.1"`. This suggests the packages _should_ be available if `npm install` was successful.

2.  **Plugin Declaration and Availability in Configuration**: The ESLint configuration file (`eslint.config.mjs` for this project) must explicitly declare and make the plugin available to the configuration blocks where its rules are referenced.
    - _Codebase Check (`eslint.config.mjs`)_:
      - The configuration uses `FlatCompat` to extend `'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended'`:
        ```javascript
        {
          files: ['**/*.ts', '**/*.tsx', '**/*.mts', '**/*.cts'],
          ...compat.extends('plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended')[0],
        }
        ```
      - A separate configuration object attempts to customize `@typescript-eslint` rules (e.g., `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`):
        ```javascript
        {
          files: ['**/*.js', '**/*.jsx', '**/*.ts', '**/*.tsx', '**/*.mjs', '**/*.cjs'],
          rules: {
            '@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars': [ /* ... */ ],
            '@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any': 'warn',
            // ...
          },
        }
        ```
      - **Potential Issue**: The error `Could not find plugin "@typescript-eslint"` suggests that when ESLint processes the second configuration object (customizing the rules), the `@typescript-eslint` plugin is not recognized as being "active" or available for that block. While `compat.extends` should theoretically register the plugin, the way flat config handles plugin resolution means that the block defining specific rules might require its own explicit `plugins: { '@typescript-eslint': ... }` declaration, or the plugin needs to be registered more globally in a way that all subsequent blocks can access it. The separation of the extension and the custom rule definition seems to be the focal point of the failure.

The error message "Could not find plugin "@typescript-eslint" in configuration" points directly to a failure in how the plugin is made available to all parts of the configuration that reference its rules.

### Potential Scenarios:

1.  **Missing Plugin Package(s)**:

    - The packages `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and/or `@typescript-eslint/parser` might not be listed in the `package.json`'s `devDependencies`.
    - Even if listed, they might not have been installed correctly. This could occur if `npm install` or `yarn install` was not run after cloning the repository, after a `git reset` that might have altered `package.json` or `package-lock.json`/`yarn.lock`, or if the `node_modules` directory is corrupted.
    - The `git reset --hard 3edbb2e` command executed earlier could have reverted `package.json`, lock files, or `eslint.config.mjs` to a state where this flat config setup for `@typescript-eslint` is problematic, perhaps due to subtle version incompatibilities or a configuration pattern that is no longer robust with the current ESLint/plugin versions.

2.  **Plugin Not Declared (Correctly for Flat Config Scope) in ESLint Configuration**:

    - As detailed above, while there's an attempt to include the plugin via `compat.extends`, the configuration block that customizes specific `@typescript-eslint` rules (like `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`) does not appear to have the `@typescript-eslint` plugin explicitly defined within its own `plugins` property. In ESLint's flat config, a configuration object that specifies rules from a plugin generally also needs to declare that plugin.
    - It's important to note that your project uses `eslint.config.mjs`, as indicated by the project structure, so the flat config model applies.

3.  **Incorrect ESLint Configuration File Being Used**:

    - While less likely given the specific error, ESLint might be picking up an unintended configuration file, or the primary configuration file might be malformed, preventing the correct loading of plugins.

4.  **Scope of Plugin Application (Relevant for Flat Config)**:
    - In ESLint's flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`), plugins are often associated with specific file patterns. If the `@typescript-eslint` plugin is configured but not correctly applied to the files being linted (e.g., `.ts` or `.tsx` files), rules from that plugin might not be recognized for those files. The error message, however, suggests a more fundamental issue of the plugin itself not being found during the configuration parsing, rather than a misapplication to specific files.

## Conclusion

The most probable cause, especially considering the recent `git reset` and the structure of `eslint.config.mjs`, is that the `@typescript-eslint` plugin, despite being installed, is not correctly registered or made available within the specific scope of the flat configuration block where its rules (like `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`) are being customized. ESLint is attempting to enforce a rule from a namespace (`@typescript-eslint`) for which it has no loaded plugin _in that specific configuration context_.

The use of `FlatCompat` to extend a traditional configuration string (`plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended`) and then separately defining rules from this plugin in another configuration object without explicitly re-declaring the plugin in the latter object's `plugins` field is the likely source of the "plugin not found" error in the context of flat configuration.

To rectify this, without altering the codebase (as per the request), one would typically ensure:
a. The `package.json` correctly lists `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser`. (This appears to be the case).
b. A fresh `npm install` or `yarn install` is executed to ensure `node_modules` is up-to-date and consistent with lock files.
c. The `eslint.config.mjs` file is structured such that any block defining rules from `@typescript-eslint` also explicitly includes `@typescript-eslint` in its `plugins` definition, or ensures the plugin is registered more globally in a way that all subsequent blocks can access it. For example, by importing `tseslint from '@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin'` and `tsParser from '@typescript-eslint/parser'` and using them directly in the flat config objects.

Since no codebase changes are permitted for this investigation, this analysis focuses solely on identifying the failure points based on the provided error and ESLint flat configuration principles.

## Solution Attempted (Date: 2025-05-20)

Based on the analysis, the following changes were applied to `eslint.config.mjs`:

1.  **Imported `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`**:
    ```javascript
    import tsEslintPlugin from '@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin';
    ```
2.  **Declared the plugin in the custom overrides block**:
    `javascript
// ...
{
  files: ['**/*.js', '**/*.jsx', '**/*.ts', '**/*.tsx', '**/*.mjs', '**/*.cjs'],
  plugins: {
    '@typescript-eslint': tsEslintPlugin, // Explicitly added plugin
  },
  rules: {
    '@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars': [/* ... */],
    // ...
  },
}
// ...
`
    This aims to ensure the `@typescript-eslint` plugin is explicitly available in the configuration scope where its rules are being customized, directly addressing the "plugin not found" error.

## Update (Date: 2025-05-20)

After applying the fix for `@typescript-eslint`, a new, similar ESLint error emerged during the build:

`Linting and checking validity of types ... тип ESLint: Key "rules": Key "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": Could not find plugin "react-hooks" in configuration.`

This indicates the same pattern of a plugin not being found in the configuration scope where its rules are being used. The `react-hooks` plugin needs to be explicitly declared in the relevant configuration block.

**Next Solution Attempt:**

Applying the same fix strategy to the `react-hooks` plugin in `eslint.config.mjs` by ensuring it's declared in the `plugins` section of the configuration block that uses `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`.

## Resolution (Date: 2025-05-20)

The `react-hooks` plugin was added to the `plugins` object of the relevant configuration block in `eslint.config.mjs`:

```javascript
// In the "custom overrides" block
plugins: {
  '@typescript-eslint': tsEslintPlugin,
  'react-hooks': reactHooks, // Added this line
},
```

Subsequent execution of `npm run build` completed successfully without any "Could not find plugin" errors from ESLint. The build now only shows linting warnings (e.g., for `no-unused-vars`, `no-explicit-any`, `exhaustive-deps`), indicating that the plugins are correctly loaded and their rules are being applied as configured.

The root cause for the series of "plugin not found" errors was confirmed to be the scoping of plugins within ESLint's flat configuration (`eslint.config.mjs`). Plugins need to be explicitly available (e.g., declared in a `plugins` object) within the configuration block where their rules are directly referenced or customized.
