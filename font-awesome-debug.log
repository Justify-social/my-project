2. Fix the getProIcon function in IconTester.tsx:
[2025-03-20T17:19:19.364Z]    - Add proper validation for iconName parameter
[2025-03-20T17:19:19.365Z]    - Convert camelCase to kebab-case properly
[2025-03-20T17:19:19.365Z]    - Add try/catch for findIconDefinition calls
[2025-03-20T17:19:19.365Z]    - Return a safe fallback for invalid icons
[2025-03-20T17:19:19.365Z] 
3. Add guards in the render method:
[2025-03-20T17:19:19.365Z]    - Add proper null/undefined checks before rendering icons
[2025-03-20T17:19:19.366Z]    - Use conditional rendering to avoid passing empty objects
