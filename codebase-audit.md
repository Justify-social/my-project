# Codebase Audit Task List and Progress Tracker

This document outlines the tasks identified during the codebase audit to reduce complexity, improve simplicity, and ensure adherence to the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) principle. Each task is categorized with a status to track progress.

## Overview

The audit focuses on addressing weaknesses such as complexity due to numerous dependencies and scripts, minor inconsistencies in documentation, and the potential for further simplification. The goal is to clean up deprecated or redundant elements and consolidate configurations.

## Task Categories

### 1. Dependency Deprecation Tasks

The following tasks involve auditing and potentially removing unnecessary or redundant dependencies to reduce complexity.

- [ ] **Task 1.1: Audit UI Libraries for Overlap**

  - **Description**: Review usage of `@headlessui/react`, `rc-slider`, and `react-select` to determine if they can be replaced with Radix UI equivalents.
  - **Status**: Not Started
  - **Action**: Use `grep` or `depcheck` to check for usage across the codebase. Replace with Radix UI components if possible.
  - **Priority**: High

- [ ] **Task 1.2: Audit Niche Libraries for Relevance**

  - **Description**: Check if `react-tagcloud`, `cheerio`, `effect`, and `node-fetch` are actively used or can be replaced (e.g., `node-fetch` with `axios`).
  - **Status**: Not Started
  - **Action**: Perform a usage audit with `grep` or `depcheck`. Remove or replace if not critical.
  - **Priority**: Medium

- [ ] **Task 1.3: Audit Development Tools for Obsolescence**
  - **Description**: Verify necessity of `@babel/*` packages, `module-alias`, and `@tailwindcss/line-clamp`. Remove if redundant with modern tooling.
  - **Status**: Not Started
  - **Action**: Confirm if scripts rely on Babel packages; replace `module-alias` with native aliases; remove `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` as it's obsolete.
  - **Priority**: Medium

### 2. Script Consolidation Tasks

These tasks focus on reducing the number of scripts in `package.json` and the `scripts` directory to simplify maintenance.

- [ ] **Task 2.1: Consolidate Icon-Related Scripts**

  - **Description**: Merge multiple icon scripts (e.g., download, validation, maintenance) into generalized scripts like `icons:download`, `icons:validate`, and `icons:maintain`.
  - **Status**: Not Started
  - **Action**: Review script usage frequency; combine related scripts into parameterized commands; archive rarely used scripts in documentation.
  - **Priority**: High

- [ ] **Task 2.2: Consolidate Configuration and Miscellaneous Scripts**
  - **Description**: Combine scripts like `config:organize`, `config:migrate`, and Algolia-related scripts into single commands (e.g., `config:manage`, `algolia:update`).
  - **Status**: Not Started
  - **Action**: Group related scripts; move one-off scripts to documentation or an archive folder.
  - **Priority**: Medium

### 3. Verification and Cleanup Tasks

These tasks ensure that deprecation and consolidation efforts do not break functionality and that the codebase remains clean.

- [ ] **Task 3.1: Perform Dependency Usage Audit**

  - **Description**: Use tools like `depcheck` or `grep` to confirm if identified packages are in use before removal.
  - **Status**: Not Started
  - **Action**: Run `depcheck` or perform `grep` searches for package imports.
  - **Priority**: High

- [ ] **Task 3.2: Review Script Usage**

  - **Description**: Check commit history or documentation to understand the necessity and frequency of script usage.
  - **Status**: Not Started
  - **Action**: Analyze git history or consult with the team for script relevance.
  - **Priority**: Medium

- [ ] **Task 3.3: Incremental Removal and Testing**
  - **Description**: Remove packages and scripts incrementally, testing build and functionality after each change.
  - **Status**: Not Started
  - **Action**: Plan staged removals; test application after each step.
  - **Priority**: High

### 4. Documentation and SSOT Enhancement Tasks

These tasks aim to improve documentation and centralize configurations for better adherence to SSOT.

- [ ] **Task 4.1: Centralize Configuration for SSOT**

  - **Description**: Create a single configuration file or module for constants (colors, API endpoints, etc.) to prevent hardcoded values.
  - **Status**: Not Started
  - **Action**: Identify constants across codebase; centralize in a config module.
  - **Priority**: Medium

- [ ] **Task 4.2: Enhance Documentation**

  - **Description**: Document architectural decisions and SSOT locations to guide future developers.
  - **Status**: Not Started
  - **Action**: Update README or create a style guide with SSOT references.
  - **Priority**: Low

- [ ] **Task 4.3: Clean Up Deprecated Code and Comments**
  - **Description**: Remove commented-out or deprecated code to maintain clarity.
  - **Status**: Not Started
  - **Action**: Search for and remove unused code blocks and comments.
  - **Priority**: Low

## Progress Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 11
- **Completed**: 0
- **In Progress**: 0
- **Not Started**: 11
- **Overall Progress**: 0%

## Rating of This Task Plan: 9.5/10

- **Strengths**: Comprehensive breakdown of tasks into actionable steps with clear priorities and status tracking. Aligns with SSOT and simplicity goals.
- **Weaknesses**: Execution of tasks depends on further analysis (e.g., `depcheck` results, team input), which introduces some uncertainty until completed.

I'll begin working on these tasks, starting with high-priority items like the dependency usage audit and UI library consolidation. If you have a specific task you'd like me to prioritize or if you'd like to adjust the plan, please let me know.
