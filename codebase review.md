---

## Detailed Technical Analysis

### 1. Architecture & Design Patterns

**Rating: 9.0/10**

#### Strengths:

- **Excellent use of Next.js 15 App Router**: Proper route groups, layouts, and server components
- **Atomic Design Implementation**: Clear component hierarchy (atoms → molecules → organisms)
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Well-structured feature modules (`/features/campaigns`, `/features/brand-lift`)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean boundaries between UI, business logic, and data layers
- **Microservice-Ready**: Modular service architecture in `/services/` directory

#### Code Example Analysis:

```typescript
// Excellent middleware implementation with proper auth flow
export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  const { userId } = await auth();
  if (!userId && !isPublicRoute(req)) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(signInUrl);
  }
  return NextResponse.next();
});
```

#### Areas for Improvement:

- Some services (e.g., `insightiqService.ts` at 828 lines) could benefit from decomposition
- Consider implementing hexagonal architecture for better testability

### 2. Type Safety & TypeScript Usage

**Rating: 8.8/10**

#### Strengths:

- **Strict TypeScript Configuration**: `strict: true` with comprehensive compiler options
- **Excellent Type Coverage**: Strong typing throughout API routes and components
- **Prisma Integration**: Auto-generated types provide excellent database type safety
- **Custom Type System**: Well-defined domain types in `/types/` directory

```typescript
// Example of excellent type safety in API routes
export async function PUT(
  req: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ commentId: string }> }
) {
  const { commentId } = await params;
  const validation = updateCommentStatusSchema.safeParse(body);
  if (!validation.success) {
    logger.warn('Invalid data', { errors: validation.error.flatten() });
  }
}
```

#### Areas for Improvement:

- Some `any` types remain (though properly documented with ESLint disable comments)
- Could benefit from more discriminated unions for complex state management

### 3. Database Design & Data Management

**Rating: 9.2/10**

#### Strengths:

- **Sophisticated Schema Design**: 25+ models with proper relationships and constraints
- **Audit Trail Implementation**: `WizardHistory` model for change tracking
- **Performance Optimizations**: Strategic indexing on frequently queried fields
- **Multi-tenancy Support**: Proper `orgId` implementation for data isolation
- **Complex Business Logic**: Brand lift studies, campaign workflows, influencer marketplace

```sql
-- Example of well-designed relationship
model CampaignWizard {
  creativeAssets   CreativeAsset[] @relation("CampaignWizardToCreativeAssets")
  submissionId     Int?            @unique
  submission       CampaignWizardSubmission? @relation("WizardToSubmission")
  @@index([status, createdAt])
  @@index([orgId])
}
```

#### Areas for Improvement:

- Some JSON fields could be normalized for better query performance
- Consider implementing database-level soft deletes for audit compliance

### 4. Security Implementation

- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (USER, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN)
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for API validation
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses without data leakage
- **Environment Management**: Proper secrets handling

```typescript
// Excellent input validation pattern
const validation = updateCommentStatusSchema.safeParse(body);
if (!validation.success) {
  throw new BadRequestError('Invalid data structure');
}
```

#### Areas for Improvement:

- Missing rate limiting implementation
- Could benefit from OWASP security headers
- API endpoints need more comprehensive input sanitization

### 5. Performance & Optimization

- **Image Optimization**: Could implement more aggressive image compression
- **Database Connection Pooling**: May need optimization for high concurrency

**Bundle Analysis Needed:**

```bash
npm run analyze  # Should reveal opportunities for tree-shaking
```

### 6. Testing Strategy

collectCoverageFrom: ['src/components/ui/**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
coverageDirectory: '<rootDir>/coverage/components',
testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
```

#### Areas for Improvement:

- **Coverage Metrics**: Current focus only on UI components
- **API Testing**: More comprehensive API route testing needed

 * Logger class that provides consistent logging with different levels
 * and structured data capabilities.
 */
export class Logger {
  private options: LoggerOptions;

  constructor(options: LoggerOptions = {}) {
    this.options = {
      minLevel: LogLevel.INFO,
      includeTimestamp: true,
      includeStackTrace: true,
      silent: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'test',
      ...options,
    };
  }
}
```

#### Areas for Improvement:

- **Complexity Metrics**: Some files exceed recommended complexity thresholds
