# Templates

Templates are page-level objects that place components into a layout and provide context for those components. They focus on the page's underlying content structure rather than the visual design.

Templates consist mostly of groups of organisms and molecules stitched together to form pages. They create reusable layouts with consistent content regions.

## Guidelines

- Templates should establish a clear content structure
- Focus on composition over customization
- Document all template sections and regions
- Consider different viewport sizes and responsive behaviors
