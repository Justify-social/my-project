# Molecules

Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together that take on distinct new properties. In interfaces, molecules are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit.

For example, a form label, input field, and button can join together to create a search form molecule.

## Guidelines

- Molecules should be focused on doing one thing well
- They should be relatively simple combinations of atoms
- Maintain as much reusability as possible
- Document how the atoms work together
