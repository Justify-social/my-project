# Organisms

Organisms are complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms. These organisms form distinct sections of an interface.

While molecules are relatively simple combinations of atoms, organisms are more complex and can represent entire interface sections like headers, footers, or complex cards.

## Guidelines

- Organisms should be focused on a specific interface section
- They can contain multiple interacting elements
- They represent a standalone, reusable component
- Document the different states and variations
