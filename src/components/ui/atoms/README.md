# Atoms

Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. In the interface, atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form label, an input, or a button. They also include more abstract elements like color palettes, fonts, and animations.

Atoms can't be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional. They're the simplest components in our design system.

## Guidelines

- Each atom should do one thing and do it well
- Atoms should be highly reusable across the application
- Keep atoms as pure and stateless as possible
- Atoms should have comprehensive prop types and documentation
