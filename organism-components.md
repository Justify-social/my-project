it looks like you have tried to use LUCIDE!! 

We are not using lucide on our app we are using our own icons please fix this 

please then continue to work through the ORGANISM components only that do not have a stable tag - see screenshot

search the codebase and graphiti

ok now i want to continue to finalise the UI components in this page

please work through the ORGANISM here

/Users/edadams/my-project/src/app/(admin)/debug-tools/ui-components/preview

please remove this text:
Basic Usage
(Manually add rendering example for
here)

make the UI components 10/10 - extremely robust clearly following the Shadcn UI structure and our app's style: colour palette + typography

please THEN make sure you update the original file here with STABLE /Users/edadams/my-project/src/components/ui

once you have completed your edit

the next one from the screenshot is "input"

this is the 101 for the developer so make them very extensive!
