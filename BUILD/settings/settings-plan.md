# Clerk Authentication & Settings UI Implementation Plan

## Existing Codebase & SSOT File Directory

**Purpose**: To maintain a Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for all authentication and settings-related files, ensuring no duplicate files or logic exist in the codebase. This section maps the existing codebase structure to the planned implementation, identifying where new files will be created and where existing files will be enhanced for simplicity and modularity.

- **Authentication Pages**:
  - **Existing**: `src/app/sign-in/page.tsx` - Will be enhanced to integrate Clerk's `<SignIn>` component, maintaining SSOT by reusing the existing file.
  - **New**: `src/app/sign-up/[[...signup]]/page.tsx` - To be created for Sign-Up page using Clerk's `<SignUp>` component, as no existing file was found.
- **Settings Pages**:
  - **New**: `src/app/(settings)/layout.tsx` - Central layout file for settings navigation using Shadcn `<Tabs>`, to be created as no existing settings structure was found.
  - **New**: `src/app/(settings)/profile/page.tsx` - SSOT for Profile Settings Tab, integrating Clerk's `<UserProfile>` component.
  - **New**: `src/app/(settings)/team/page.tsx` - SSOT for Team Management Tab, potentially using Clerk Organizations or custom UI with Shadcn components.
  - **New**: `src/app/(settings)/branding/page.tsx` - SSOT for Branding Tab with custom settings UI using Shadcn components.
- **Configuration & Middleware**:
  - **Existing**: `src/middleware.ts` - To be verified and updated if necessary for route protection using `clerkMiddleware`.
  - **Existing**: `.env.local` - Single location for Clerk API keys and routing configuration, to be updated with necessary variables.
- **Custom Components**:
  - **Existing**: `src/components/ui/` - Contains reusable Shadcn UI components like `tabs.tsx`, `table.tsx`, `card.tsx`, and `button.tsx`, which will be leveraged for settings UI to ensure modularity and avoid duplication.
  - **New**: `src/components/features/settings/` - Proposed directory for custom settings components (e.g., Team Table, Branding Forms) if needed, to centralize custom logic and avoid scattering across pages.
- **API Routes**:
  - **New**: `src/app/api/team/` - Centralized API endpoints for team management functionalities.
  - **New**: `src/app/api/branding/` - Centralized API endpoints for branding settings.
  - **New**: `src/app/api/user/notifications/` - Centralized API endpoint for notification preferences.

**Note**: Developers must adhere to this structure, ensuring all related code is placed in the designated files or directories. Existing files are prioritized for enhancement over creating new ones to prevent duplication. Any deviation or creation of duplicate files must be reviewed and justified to maintain SSOT.

**Quality Target**: 10/10

**Goal**: Develop branded, accessible, and production-ready Sign-Up, Sign-In, and User Settings pages using Clerk, Shadcn UI, and FontAwesome, aligned with the provided Figma designs and application style guide.

**Core Principles**:
- **Simplicity**: Leverage Clerk's pre-built components (`<SignIn>`, `<SignUp>`, `<UserProfile>`) wherever possible.
- **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**: Clerk manages core authentication state and user profile data. Custom application settings (Team, Branding, Preferences) are managed via our backend/database.
- **Brand Consistency**: Strictly adhere to UI/UX guidelines, using Shadcn UI components and customizing Clerk elements to match Figma designs and defined brand colors/typography.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## Design and Branding Alignment
- **Objective**: Ensure UI strictly adheres to brand guidelines and Figma designs.
- **Actions**:
    - Apply Brand Colors consistently: Primary (Jet #333333), Secondary (Payne's Grey #4A5568), Accent (Deep Sky Blue #00BFFF), Background (White #FFFFFF), Divider (French Grey #D1D5DB), Interactive (Medium Blue #3182CE).
    - Implement FontAwesome Pro Icons (`fa-light` default, `fa-solid` hover).
    - Utilize Shadcn UI components (`Button`, `Input`, `Card`, `Tabs`, `Table`, `Switch`, `Dialog`, etc.).
    - Customize Clerk component appearance using the `appearance` prop to match Figma layouts and styles. This involves overriding default Clerk elements with Tailwind/Shadcn classes.
    - Verify color contrast and general accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA).
- **Resources**:
    - Figma Designs (attached images: `Branding.png`, `profile-settings.png`, `team-management.png`)
    - [UI Components Debug Tool](mdc:/debug-tools/ui-components)
    - [`globals.css`](mdc:src/app/globals.css) for brand colors/Tailwind config.
    - [FontAwesome Docs & Icon Registry](mdc:docs/icons/font-awesome.md)

---

## Sign-Up and Sign-In Pages Implementation
- **Objective**: Create branded, user-friendly, secure sign-up/sign-in pages matching Figma (design assumed similar to standard login forms, adapt as needed if specific Figma provided).
- **Files**: `app/signin/[[...signin]]/page.tsx`, `app/signup/[[...signup]]/page.tsx` (using Clerk's recommended catch-all routes for path routing).
- **Actions**:
    - Use Clerk's `<SignIn />` and `<SignUp />` components.
    - Configure Clerk routing:
        - Set `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/signin` and `CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/signup` in `.env.local`.
        - Use `routing="path"` in the components.
        - Set `afterSignInUrl` and `afterSignUpUrl` (e.g., to `/dashboard`).
    - Customize appearance using the `appearance` prop:
        - Set `baseTheme: undefined` to remove default Clerk themes.
        - Use `elements` to apply Shadcn classes to Clerk elements (e.g., `formButtonPrimary`, `card`, `formFieldInput`, `formFieldLabel`, `footerActionLink`). **This allows for full visual customization to align precisely with the application's Shadcn UI theme and branding while leveraging Clerk's robust backend.** Example configuration:
          ```
          appearance: {
            baseTheme: undefined,
            elements: {
              card: 'bg-background shadow-md border-divider p-6 rounded-lg',
              formButtonPrimary: 'bg-interactive text-white hover:bg-interactive/90',
              formFieldInput: 'border-divider focus:ring-accent focus:border-accent',
              formFieldLabel: 'text-secondary font-medium',
              footerActionLink: 'text-interactive hover:underline',
            },
          }
          ```
        - Integrate brand logo component above the form with proper spacing and alignment.
    - Ensure responsive design with Tailwind's responsive classes (e.g., `md:w-96`, `sm:px-4`).

    **Note:** Using Clerk's `<SignIn />` and `<SignUp />` components, customized via the `appearance` prop, is the recommended approach to maximize Clerk's capabilities for core authentication flows, ensuring security and simplicity while maintaining complete visual control.

---

## Settings Page Implementation
- **Objective**: Develop a comprehensive, branded user settings page matching Figma designs, using Shadcn Tabs for navigation.
- **File**: `app/settings/layout.tsx` (for Tabs navigation), `app/settings/profile/page.tsx`, `app/settings/team/page.tsx`, `app/settings/branding/page.tsx` (example route structure). Note: Clerk's `<UserProfile>` often uses a catch-all (`[[...rest]]`), which needs careful integration with custom tabs. We might opt for separate pages per tab for clarity.

### Overall Structure (Tabs)
- Use Shadcn `<Tabs>` component in a layout file (`app/settings/layout.tsx`) or a parent component.
- Tabs: "Profile Settings", "Team Management", "Branding".
- Style `<TabsList>` and `<TabsTrigger>` to match Figma/app style (underline for active tab, using `border-b-2 border-accent` for active state).

### Profile Settings Tab
- **File**: `app/settings/profile/page.tsx` (or handled within `app/settings/[[...rest]]/page.tsx` if using Clerk's catch-all).
- **Component**: Clerk `<UserProfile />`.
- **Integration Strategy**:
    1.  Configure `<UserProfile routing="path" path="/settings/profile">`.
    2.  Use the `appearance` prop extensively to restyle `<UserProfile>` elements to match the Figma layout (Card, Section Headers, Inputs, Buttons). **This ensures the Clerk component blends seamlessly with the custom application UI built with Shadcn.** Example:
        ```
        appearance: {
          elements: {
            card: 'bg-background shadow-md border-divider p-6 rounded-lg',
            navbar: 'hidden', // Hide default navigation
            headerTitle: 'text-primary text-xl font-bold',
            headerSubtitle: 'text-secondary text-sm',
            formFieldInput: 'border-divider focus:ring-accent',
            formButtonPrimary: 'bg-interactive text-white',
            dividerLine: 'bg-divider',
          },
        }
        ```
    3.  **Hide Redundant Clerk UI**: Use `appearance.elements.navbar = 'hidden'` and potentially hide default card/layout wrappers (`appearance.elements.card = 'bg-transparent shadow-none border-none p-0'`, `appearance.elements.pageScrollBox = 'p-0'`) to embed Clerk's sections cleanly within our own structure if needed.
    4.  Map Clerk sections (Profile, Security) to the corresponding visual sections in Figma (Personal Information, Profile Picture, Password Management).
    5.  **Notification Preferences**: This section appears custom. Implement using Shadcn `<Switch>` components and connect to a separate API endpoint/database logic, as it's likely beyond standard Clerk profile data.
- **Key `appearance` overrides needed**: `card`, `pageScrollBox`, `navbar`, `headerTitle`, `headerSubtitle`, `formFieldInput`, `formFieldLabel`, `formButtonPrimary`, `dividerLine`, `profileSection__profile`, `profileSection__activeDevices`, etc. Inspect Clerk elements and override as needed.

### Team Management Tab
- **File**: `app/settings/team/page.tsx`.
- **Implementation**: This appears to be custom functionality based on the Figma design.

    **Clerk Organizations Investigation:**
    - **Action:** Before building custom UI/backend, investigate using Clerk's built-in Organizations feature (`<OrganizationProfile>`, `<OrganizationSwitcher>`, `<CreateOrganization>`).
    - **Goal:** Determine if Clerk Organizations can fulfill the requirements shown in the Figma design for managing members, invitations, and roles.
    - **Considerations:**
        - Does the functionality match the required user flows?
        - Are the default Clerk roles (admin, member) sufficient, or are custom roles needed (which would require custom logic)?
        - Can the Clerk components be styled via the `appearance` prop to match the Figma design?
    - **Decision:** If Clerk Organizations are suitable, update the plan to use Clerk components for this tab, significantly reducing custom code. If not suitable, proceed with the custom implementation below.

    **Custom Implementation (If Clerk Organizations are not used):**
    - Use Shadcn `<Table>` (`Table`, `TableHeader`, `TableRow`, `TableHead`, `TableBody`, `TableCell`) to display the members list (Name, Email, Role, Actions).
    - Use Shadcn `<Button>` for "Change Role", "Remove", "Add New Member".
    - Use Shadcn `<Dialog>` (Modal) for "Add New Member" and "Remove" confirmation.
    - Use Shadcn `<Select>` or `<DropdownMenu>` within the Table/Modal for "Change Role".
    - Add pagination controls below the table using Shadcn `<Button>` for navigation.
    - **Backend**: Requires separate API endpoints (e.g., `/api/team/members`, `/api/team/invitations`) and corresponding database logic (likely using `TeamMember`, `TeamInvitation` models).

### Branding Tab
- **File**: `app/settings/branding/page.tsx`.
- **Implementation**: Custom functionality.
    - Use Shadcn `<Card>` for sections (Colour Palette, Typography, Brand Logo).
    - **Colour Palette**: Use custom color picker components (or a library integrated with Shadcn) alongside Shadcn `<Input>` for hex codes.
    - **Typography**: Use Shadcn `<Select>` or custom font picker for Header/Body Typography, and `<Input type="number">` or `<Select>` for Font Size.
    - **Brand Logo**: Use a file upload component (e.g., integrating UploadThing or a custom Shadcn-styled input) with Shadcn `<Button>`. Display current logo using `<img>`.
    - **Backend**: Requires separate API endpoints (e.g., `/api/branding`) and database logic (likely using `BrandingSettings` model).

---

## Clerk Authentication Integration
- **Objective**: Ensure seamless integration with Clerk's authentication flow for the settings pages.
- **Actions**:
    - Verify `/settings/**` routes are protected in `middleware.ts` using `clerkMiddleware` with appropriate configuration.
    - Use `useAuth`, `useUser` hooks for client-side state and conditional rendering within settings pages/components.
    - Use `auth()` for server-side data fetching if needed (e.g., initial props for custom sections).

---

## User Experience and Accessibility
- **Objective**: Deliver an intuitive, accessible, and responsive UI.
- **Actions**:
    - Implement loading states using Shadcn `<Skeleton>` components for each settings section while data is fetched (both for `<UserProfile>` and custom sections).
    - Use Shadcn `<Form>` utilities for validation and error messages in custom sections (Team, Branding, Notifications).
    - Ensure full keyboard navigation for Tabs, Tables, Modals, Forms, and Buttons using appropriate ARIA roles and attributes.
    - Use appropriate ARIA attributes for all interactive elements (e.g., `aria-label` for icons, `aria-expanded` for modals).
    - Test responsiveness across devices using Tailwind's responsive utilities.
    - Validate color contrast ratios to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, especially for text over backgrounds.

---

## Backend Integration for Custom Settings
- **Objective**: Ensure seamless data synchronization between Clerk user data and custom application settings.
- **Actions**:
    - **User Mapping**: Map Clerk user IDs (`clerkId`) to application `User` records in the database upon sign-up/sign-in. Use Clerk webhooks or `useUser` hook to sync user creation/update events.
    - **Custom Settings Storage**: Store Team, Branding, and Notification Preferences in separate database models (`TeamMember`, `BrandingSettings`, `UserPreferences`) linked to the `User` model via `userId` or `clerkId`.
    - **API Endpoints**: Develop RESTful API endpoints using Next.js API routes for CRUD operations on custom settings. Example:
        - `GET /api/team/members`: Fetch team members for the authenticated user.
        - `POST /api/team/invitations`: Send team invitations.
        - `PATCH /api/branding`: Update branding settings with color codes, logo URLs.
    - **Data Validation**: Implement server-side validation for custom settings (e.g., valid hex codes for colors, file size limits for logo uploads).
    - **Error Handling**: Return meaningful error messages (e.g., HTTP 400 for invalid input, 403 for unauthorized access) and log errors for debugging.

---

## Implementation Timeline and Prioritization
- **Objective**: Provide a clear sequence of tasks to ensure efficient development and dependency management.
- **Timeline**:
    1. **Week 1: Setup and Core Authentication**
        - Verify Clerk setup, environment variables, and middleware protection for `/settings/**`.
        - Implement Sign-In and Sign-Up pages with branded `appearance` customization.
    2. **Week 2: Settings Layout and Profile Tab**
        - Develop `app/settings/layout.tsx` with Shadcn Tabs for navigation.
        - Implement Profile Settings Tab using `<UserProfile>` with detailed `appearance` overrides.
    3. **Week 3: Team Management Tab**
        - Investigate Clerk Organizations; decide on custom vs. Clerk implementation.
        - Develop custom Team Management UI with Shadcn components if needed, and stub API endpoints.
    4. **Week 4: Branding Tab and Backend Integration**
        - Implement Branding Tab with custom inputs and file upload components.
        - Develop and test API endpoints for Team, Branding, and Notification Preferences.
    5. **Week 5: Testing and Polish**
        - Conduct responsiveness and accessibility testing across all pages.
        - Implement loading states, error handling, and finalize UI polish.
- **Dependencies**:
    - Middleware protection must be verified before any settings page development.
    - Sign-In/Sign-Up pages should be functional before Settings pages to enable user authentication.
    - Backend API endpoints must be ready before custom UI sections (Team, Branding) can be fully functional.

---

## Testing Strategy
- **Objective**: Ensure high-quality implementation through comprehensive testing.
- **Actions**:
    - **Unit Tests**: Use Jest to test custom components (e.g., Team Table, Branding Form) for rendering and basic interactions.
    - **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints with Jest or Supertest to verify data handling and authentication checks.
    - **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Use Cypress or Playwright to simulate user flows (sign-up, sign-in, update settings) and verify UI-behavior integration.
    - **Accessibility Tests**: Use axe-core or Lighthouse to validate WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
    - **Manual Testing**: Perform manual testing on multiple devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) and browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) for responsiveness and UX.
    - **User Flow Validation**: Test complete authentication and settings update cycles to ensure data persistence and error recovery.

## 12. UI Component Analysis for Settings UI

### Analysis of Settings UI Requirements

The Settings UI, as detailed in this document, requires a variety of UI components to support its user flows across Sign-Up, Sign-In, and Settings pages (with tabs for Profile Settings, Team Management, and Branding). Given the adherence to the atomic UI structure (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages), the needs are broken down accordingly. The goal is to reuse existing Shadcn UI components where possible, identify gaps for new components, and assess if direct downloads from Shadcn can accelerate development.

**Key UI Needs for Settings UI**:
1. **Sign-Up and Sign-In Pages**:
   - Form containers and input fields for user credentials.
   - Buttons for submission and alternative actions (e.g., "Forgot Password").
   - Logo display area for branding.
2. **Settings Page - Overall Structure**:
   - Tab navigation for switching between Profile, Team, and Branding sections.
3. **Profile Settings Tab**:
   - Form sections for personal information, profile picture upload, password management, and notification preferences.
   - Input fields, buttons, and toggles for settings adjustments.
4. **Team Management Tab**:
   - Table for displaying team members (Name, Email, Role, Actions).
   - Modals for adding new members or confirming removals.
   - Dropdowns or select components for role changes.
   - Pagination controls for large member lists.
5. **Branding Tab**:
   - Cards or containers for sections like Colour Palette, Typography, and Brand Logo.
   - Color picker for selecting brand colors.
   - Font selector for typography settings.
   - File upload component for logo updates.

### Review of Existing Shadcn UI Components

Based on the structure in the project's UI component directory and the UI Component Browser page, it is assumed that the project already includes a set of Shadcn UI components that follow the atomic design structure. Common Shadcn components likely available include:
- **Atoms**: `Button`, `Input`, `Card`, `Icon`, `Switch`, `Skeleton` (for loading states).
- **Molecules**: `Form`, `Select`, `DropdownMenu`, `Table`, `Dialog` (modals).
- **Organisms**: `Tabs`, potentially some dashboard or layout components.

These components cover many of the basic needs for forms, buttons, tables, modals, and layout structures required by the Settings UI. However, there are specific functionalities (like color pickers and file uploads for branding) that may not be part of the standard Shadcn UI library or existing components.

### Additional UI Components Needed for Settings UI

Following the atomic UI structure, here are the additional components anticipated to be created or adapted for the Settings UI, categorized by atomic level:

1. **Atoms**:
   - No significant new atomic components are needed beyond what's likely available in Shadcn UI. Existing atoms like `Button`, `Input`, and `Icon` should suffice for basic elements.

2. **Molecules**:
   - **ColorPicker**: A component for selecting colors in the Branding Tab (for Colour Palette). This would likely require integrating a library like `react-color` and styling it with Tailwind CSS to match brand guidelines.
   - **FileUpload**: A component for uploading brand logos in the Branding Tab. This could build on an existing `Input` component styled for file selection or integrate a library like `react-dropzone`, ensuring it matches Shadcn aesthetics.

3. **Organisms**:
   - **SettingsTabContainer**: A component to manage the tabbed interface for Settings, integrating `Tabs` from Shadcn with custom styling to match Figma designs. This would handle navigation between Profile, Team, and Branding tabs.
   - **ProfileSettingsForm**: A component to manage the layout of the Profile Settings Tab, combining Clerk's `<UserProfile>` styled elements with custom sections (like Notification Preferences using `Switch` components).
   - **TeamManagementDashboard**: A component for the Team Management Tab, combining `Table`, `Dialog`, `Select`, and `Button` components to manage team members, roles, and invitations.
   - **BrandingSettingsPanel**: A component for the Branding Tab, integrating `Card`, `ColorPicker`, `FileUpload`, and `Select` components to manage color palettes, typography, and logo uploads.

4. **Templates**:
   - **AuthPageTemplate**: A layout template to standardize the structure of Sign-Up and Sign-In pages, ensuring consistent placement of logos, forms, and buttons with responsive design.
   - **SettingsPageTemplate**: A layout template for the Settings page, standardizing the tab navigation and content area layout to ensure consistency across different tabs.

5. **Pages**:
   - Specific page components for each part of the Settings UI (e.g., `SignInPage`, `SignUpPage`, `SettingsProfilePage`, `SettingsTeamPage`, `SettingsBrandingPage`), which would use the above organisms and templates.

### Can We Speed Up by Downloading from Shadcn UI?

Shadcn UI provides a library of reusable components that can be directly installed or copied into a project, which can significantly speed up development for common UI elements. Here's how this can be leveraged:

- **Directly Usable Components from Shadcn UI**:
  - Many of the atomic and molecular components needed (e.g., `Button`, `Input`, `Card`, `Select`, `DropdownMenu`, `Switch`, `Dialog`, `Table`, `Tabs`) are likely already part of Shadcn UI or can be directly downloaded from their repository or via their CLI tool if you use it (`npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component-name>`).
  - If any of these are missing from the current UI component directory, they can be quickly added by following Shadcn's installation guide. This avoids custom development for basic components.

- **Components Requiring Customization**:
  - No significant customization is needed for most Shadcn components beyond applying brand colors (e.g., Primary: Jet #333333, Accent: Deep Sky Blue #00BFFF) and FontAwesome icons (`fa-light` default, `fa-solid` hover). This can be done via Tailwind CSS classes or minor style adjustments.

- **Components Requiring New Development**:
  - Specialized components like `ColorPicker` and `FileUpload` are unlikely to be directly available in Shadcn UI. These will need custom development but can build on Shadcn primitives (e.g., `Input`, `Button`) for consistency.
  - For `ColorPicker`, you'll need to integrate an external library (e.g., `react-color`) and wrap it in a custom component styled with Tailwind CSS to match brand guidelines.
  - For `FileUpload`, you can integrate a library like `react-dropzone` or use a styled `Input` component with `type="file"`, ensuring it aligns with Shadcn aesthetics.
  - Larger components like `SettingsTabContainer`, `ProfileSettingsForm`, `TeamManagementDashboard`, and `BrandingSettingsPanel` will require custom development but can heavily reuse Shadcn components for their sub-elements.

- **Speeding Up with Shadcn**:
  - **Recommendation**: Use Shadcn UI's CLI or manually copy any missing basic components (atoms and molecules) directly into the UI component directory. This can save significant time for components like `Tabs`, `Table`, or `Dialog` if they aren't already present.
  - **Process**: Check the Shadcn UI documentation or repository (likely at `shadcn/ui` or via their CLI) for available components. For each missing component, run the appropriate command or copy the code, ensuring it's placed in the correct atomic category in the structure (e.g., atoms for `Button`, molecules for `Select`).
  - **Customization**: After downloading, customize these components with brand colors and FontAwesome icons as needed, using the `/debug-tools/ui-components` tool to validate the look and feel.

### Summary of Action Plan

1. **Audit Existing Components**:
   - Review the contents of the UI component directory to confirm which Shadcn components are already present and categorize them by atomic level (atoms, molecules, etc.).
   - Use the `/debug-tools/ui-components` page to visually inspect available components and their styles.

2. **Download Missing Shadcn Components**:
   - Identify any basic components needed for Settings UI that are missing (e.g., `Tabs`, `Table`, `Dialog`) and download them directly from Shadcn UI using their CLI or by copying from their repository.
   - Place them in the appropriate atomic structure directories (e.g., atoms for basic elements, molecules for compound components).

3. **Develop Custom Components**:
   - Plan development for specialized components like `ColorPicker` and `FileUpload`, building on Shadcn primitives where possible.
   - Integrate external libraries for color selection (e.g., `react-color`) and file uploads (e.g., `react-dropzone`), ensuring they are styled to match brand guidelines.
   - Develop larger organisms and templates like `SettingsTabContainer` and `TeamManagementDashboard`, reusing Shadcn components extensively.

4. **Follow Atomic Structure**:
   - Ensure all new components are organized into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages, maintaining consistency with the existing structure.
   - For example, `ColorPicker` (molecule) builds into `BrandingSettingsPanel` (organism), which is used in `SettingsBrandingPage` (page).

5. **Validate with Brand Guidelines**:
   - Apply brand colors, FontAwesome icon styles (`fa-light` default, `fa-solid` hover), and validate all components using `/debug-tools/ui-components` to ensure consistency.

### Conclusion and Rating
