Okay, as Scrum Master, with the detailed `plan.md` finalized and agreed upon, here are the immediate next steps to systematically break this down and get the development team mobilized:

1.  **Confirm Critical Prerequisite: API Contracts (Task Zero):**
    *   **Action:** ~~Immediately assign and prioritize **Ticket 0.5.1 (`CHORE(API): Define API Contracts (MVP)`)**.~~
    *   **Why:** ~~This is the absolute lynchpin for the parallel development strategy. Frontend and Backend teams *cannot* work effectively in parallel without a locked-in agreement on how they will communicate (the API request/response structure for `GET /influencers` and `GET /influencers/:id`).~~
    *   **Owner:** ~~Typically Backend Lead/Architect, with input and sign-off from Frontend Lead.~~
    *   **Timeline:** ~~Needs to be completed ASAP, ideally before the first Sprint officially starts or as the very first task within it.~~
    *   **Status:** **DONE**. Finalized contract documented in `/docs/api/influencer-marketplace.yaml` (or linked section in `plan.md`). **FE & BE Leads have formally accepted this contract.**

**Definition of Ready (DoR) for Tickets:**

Before a ticket from `plan.md` can be pulled into a Sprint Backlog, it should meet the following criteria:
*   **Clear Requirements:** The Goal and Action steps are understood by the team. Any `TODOs` affecting the ticket are resolved.
*   **Dependencies Resolved/Planned:** Any blocking UI component dependencies (from Dep Checks) or API contract dependencies are resolved or have clear CHORE tickets planned.
*   **Dependencies on *other teams/services*** (if any) identified and communication initiated.
*   **Verification Criteria Clear:** The team understands how to verify the ticket is complete.
*   **Estimation Feasible:** The team feels they have enough information to estimate the effort (if using estimation).

2.  **Prepare for Sprint 1 Planning: Backlog Refinement:**
    *   **Action:** Review **Phase 0 & Foundational Phase 1 tickets** from `plan.md` as primary candidates for the Sprint 1 Backlog. These enable the parallel streams:
        *   **Core Setup:**
            *   `0.1: CHORE: Create Core Directory Structure` ✅ **(Done)**
            *   `0.2: TYPE: Define InfluencerSummary Type (MVP)` ✅ **(Done)**
            *   `0.3: TYPE: Define InfluencerProfileData Type (MVP)` ✅ **(Done)**
            *   `0.4: TYPE: Extend DraftCampaignData in WizardContext` ✅ **(Done)**
            *   `0.5: DATA: Create Mock Influencer Data File` ✅ **(Done)**
            *   `0.9: CHORE: Implement Service Abstraction Layer` ✅ **(Done)**
            *   `0.10: CHORE(DB): Define Initial Database Indexes` ✅ **(Done)**
            *   `0.13: CHORE(Config): Setup Phyllo API Key Management` (Using Sandbox keys) ✅ **(Done)**
            *   *Note: Mock service implementation (0.6-0.8) serves primarily as a fallback during BE deployment delays or for isolated FE testing (e.g., Storybook), **not** as the primary development target. Frontend development (Ticket 1.4 onwards) MUST integrate with live dev/staging backend APIs ASAP.*
        *   **Backend Foundation (Sprint 1 Focus - REVISED STATUS):**
            *   `0.11: BE-SETUP: Initialize Influencer DB Models & Basic API Routes` ✅ **(Done)**
            *   `0.12: BE-SETUP: Implement Phyllo Service Initial Connection` ✅ **(Done)**
            *   `0.14: CHORE(API): Verify Existing Phyllo User/Token Endpoints` ✅ **(Done)**
            *   `1.0: BE-FEAT: Implement GET /influencers v1 (Core Data + Phyllo Verification)` ⏳ **(Route exists, but data sync blocked by webhooks)**
            *   `1.1: BE-FEAT: Implement GET /influencers/:id v1 (Core Profile Data)` ⏳ **(Route exists, but data sync blocked by webhooks)**
            *   `1.9: BE-FEAT: Implement MVP Justify Score v1 Calculation` ⏳ **(Logic likely exists, but depends on data from 1.0/1.1 which is blocked)**
            *   **(NEW) BE-WEBHOOK-SETUP: Implement Backend Webhook Handler (`/api/webhooks/phyllo`)` ⏳ **(Placeholder created, logic pending)**
        *   **Frontend Foundation (Sprint 1 Focus - REVISED STATUS):**
            *   `1.2: FEAT(UI): Build InfluencerSummaryCard Component` ✅ **(Done)**
            *   `1.3: FEAT(UI): Setup Marketplace Page (`page.tsx`) & Initial State` ✅ **(Done)**
            *   `1.4: FEAT(FE): Implement Initial Data Fetching on Marketplace Page` ✅ **(Done - Currently fetches empty list due to backend)**
            *   `1.5: FEAT(UI): Create MarketplaceList Component` ✅ **(Done - Currently shows empty state)**
    *   **Action:** **Clarify `TODOs` (Pre-Planning):** Resolve `TODOs` from Ticket 0.3 (incl. clarifying MVP fields) with Product Owner.
    *   **Action:** **Initiate UI Dependency Check (Pre-Planning):** Audit UI library (Ticket 1.2 Dep Check) and create `CHORE(UI)` tickets for gaps.
    *   **Action:** **Confirm Backend Task Details & Readiness (Pre-Planning):** Simultaneously, the Backend team confirms the details and their readiness to start on their prioritized Sprint 1 tickets (0.11, 0.12, 0.14, 1.0, 1.1, 1.9) based on finalized API contracts and sandbox credentials. **This includes verifying the required Phyllo `products` list in the existing `/api/phyllo/sdk-token` endpoint (part of Ticket 0.14).** **BLOCKER:** Priority must be given to implementing the Webhook Handler logic.

3.  **Facilitate Sprint 1 Planning Meeting:**
    *   **Goal:** Create the Sprint Backlog - the list of specific **FE and BE tickets** the team commits to completing in the first sprint to enable the initial integrated flow against the sandbox.
    *   **Sprint 1 Goal Suggestion (Revised):** *"Establish foundational FE/BE code structures, implement core Backend API routes, build initial Marketplace UI components, and **implement the Phyllo webhook handler to enable initial data synchronization.**"*
    *   **Process:**
        *   Present the updated `plan.md`, emphasizing the MVP goal, user value, **confirmed API contracts**, and the **parallel strategy using the sandbox**. Highlight the shift away from heavy mock data reliance **AND the critical need for webhook implementation.**
        *   Discuss the refined list of candidate tickets (from Step 2 above) ensuring all meet the Definition of Ready (DoR). **Prioritize the webhook handler implementation.**
        *   Explicitly discuss dependencies (e.g., FE data display depending on BE webhook processing & API updates).
        *   Explicitly discuss and confirm understanding of the *integration points* and dependencies *between* selected FE and BE tickets within the Sprint.
        *   The **Development Team (FE & BE)** selects the amount of work they forecast they can complete, pulling tickets into their Sprint Backlog. Sub-tasking is encouraged.

4.  **Create Actionable Tickets in Project Management Tool:**
    *   **Action:** Transfer the tickets committed to in Sprint Planning from `plan.md` into your team's tool (Jira, Asana, etc.). **Include the new Webhook Handler ticket.**
    *   **Details:** Ensure **all** relevant details are copied: Goal, Action Steps, Verification Criteria, Dependencies, and specific Notes (Integration Mandate, Data Source, Customer Focus, etc.). Link tickets back to `plan.md`.
    *   **Assignment:** Assign owners (FE/BE) to each ticket based on team discussion during planning.

5.  **Kick Off Sprint 1 & Facilitate:**
    *   **Action:** The team begins working on the tickets in the Sprint Backlog.
    *   **Scrum Master Role:**
        *   **Monitor API Contract Adherence:** Ensure both teams are strictly following the agreed contracts.
        *   **Facilitate Daily Standups:** Track progress on *both* FE and BE streams, **specifically monitoring progress on the Webhook Handler implementation**. Proactively identify impediments.
        *   **Verify Environment Readiness:** Confirm `dev` and/or `staging` environments are ready early for **Webhook Handler deployment** and subsequent BE API testing.
        *   **Protect MVP Scope:** Gently prevent scope creep beyond the defined MVP tickets.
        *   **Ensure Communication Flow:** Actively facilitate communication between FE and BE developers, especially around the deployment and testing of the Webhook Handler and its effect on the API endpoints (Tickets 1.0, 1.1).
        *   **Track Critical Path Dependencies:** **The Webhook Handler is now the critical path.** Pay close attention to its implementation and deployment.

By following these steps, we move from the comprehensive `plan.md` to a concrete set of prioritized tasks for the development team's first sprint, ensuring alignment and addressing critical dependencies early for the accelerated strategy.

## Projected Sprint 2: Filtering, Profile UI & Continued Integration (REVISED STATUS)

*Goal Suggestion: Implement frontend filtering connected to the **data-populated** dev API, build out the core Influencer Profile page UI consuming **data-populated** dev data, and refine initial backend endpoints based on integration feedback.*
