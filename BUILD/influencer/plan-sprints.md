**--- PIVOT NOTE (2023-06-20) ---**
**Current Focus:** We are temporarily pausing the sprint progression outlined below to prioritize the critical refactoring required for the InsightIQ integration.
**Guidance:** The detailed technical steps for this refactoring phase are outlined in `BUILD/influencer/refactor-insight-iq.md`.
**Resumption:** Sprint planning and execution based on this document (`plan-sprints.md`) and the main `plan.md` will resume once the refactoring tasks (especially those blocked by InsightIQ documentation) are sufficiently addressed.
**Action Item:** Obtain `INSIGHTIQ_WEBHOOK_SECRET` from InsightIQ support (Needed for Task 3.4: Webhook Handler Refactoring).
**----------------------------------**

**--- DECOUPLING NOTE (2023-06-21) ---**
**Scope Adjustment:** Following the decoupling decision, the Marketplace will be developed standalone for the MVP. Tickets related to Wizard-Marketplace integration (original Phase 3: Tickets 4.2-4.5) are deferred post-MVP. Sprint goals and projections below are adjusted accordingly.
**----------------------------------**

Okay, as Scrum Master, with the detailed `plan.md` (now updated for **InsightIQ**) finalized and agreed upon, here are the immediate next steps to systematically break this down and get the development team mobilized:

1.  **Confirm Critical Prerequisite: API Contracts (Task Zero - REVISED FOR InsightIQ):**
    *   **Action:** ~~Immediately assign and prioritize **Ticket 0.5.1 (`CHORE(API): Define API Contracts (MVP)`)**.~~ **Revised Action:** Review available InsightIQ OpenAPI documentation (`openapi.v1.yml`) and **schedule FE/BE meeting to finalize and sign-off on Justify API contracts** (`GET /influencers`, `GET /influencers/:id`) based on it.
    *   **Why:** This remains a lynchpin. We cannot proceed with **stable** backend implementation or accurate frontend integration without agreed contracts based on InsightIQ's actual capabilities.
    *   **Owner:** FE Lead, BE Lead for sign-off.
    *   **Timeline:** ASAP.
    *   **Status:** **OpenAPI spec available (`openapi.v1.yml`), review & sign-off pending.**

**Definition of Ready (DoR) for Tickets:**

Before a ticket from `plan.md` can be pulled into a Sprint Backlog, it should meet the following criteria:
*   **Clear Requirements:** The Goal and Action steps are understood by the team. Any `TODOs` affecting the ticket are resolved.
*   **Dependencies Resolved/Planned:** Any blocking UI component dependencies (from Dep Checks) or API contract dependencies are resolved or have clear CHORE tickets planned.
*   **Dependencies on *other teams/services*** (if any) identified and communication initiated.
*   **Verification Criteria Clear:** The team understands how to verify the ticket is complete.
*   **Estimation Feasible:** The team feels they have enough information to estimate the effort (if using estimation).

2.  **Sprint 1 Progress & Next Steps (Updated 2025-04-30):**
    *   **Action:** Review **Phase 0 & Foundational Phase 1 tickets** from `plan.md` and the **refactoring tasks** from `insightiq.md`. **Wizard integration tickets (Phase 4 in plan.md) remain deferred.**
        *   **Core Setup & Refactoring (Largely Done):**

### Immediate JIRA-Style Action Items (Sprint 1 Focus)

**Goal:** Achieve a stable end-to-end flow displaying live InsightIQ Sandbox data in the Marketplace List and Profile pages.

**Ticket ID:** SPRINT1-BE-01
**Title:** Implement Core Backend APIs with Live InsightIQ Sandbox Data
**Assignee/Team:** BE Team
**Status:** To Do
**Description:** Implement the core logic for `GET /api/influencers` and `GET /api/influencers/:id`. Use `insightiqService` to call relevant InsightIQ Sandbox endpoints (referencing `openapi.v1.yml`). Correctly map InsightIQ API responses to Justify types (`InfluencerSummary`, `InfluencerProfileData`). Implement basic error handling for InsightIQ calls. Implement basic filtering pass-through for the list endpoint if supported by InsightIQ API. Deploy functional endpoints to dev/staging.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
    - API routes return `200 OK` with correctly mapped data for valid requests to InsightIQ Sandbox.
    - API routes return appropriate error codes (e.g., 404, 503) if InsightIQ fetch fails or ID not found.
    - Basic filtering (if applicable) works.
    - Deployed to dev/staging.
**Dependencies:** `openapi.v1.yml`

**Ticket ID:** SPRINT1-LEAD-01
**Title:** Finalize & Sign-off on Justify API Contracts
**Assignee/Team:** FE Lead, BE Lead
**Status:** To Do
**Description:** Review the `openapi.v1.yml` specification. Schedule and hold a meeting to formally agree on the exact request/response schemas for the Justify backend APIs (`GET /api/influencers`, `GET /api/influencers/:id`) that the frontend will consume. Document the signed-off contract (can reference `openapi.v1.yml` with notes on Justify-specific mapping).
**Acceptance Criteria:**
    - Meeting held.
    - Final Justify API request/response schemas for core endpoints are agreed upon and documented/referenced.
    - Sign-off obtained from both leads.
**Dependencies:** `openapi.v1.yml`

**Ticket ID:** SPRINT1-FE-01
**Title:** Integrate Marketplace List/Filters with Live Backend API
**Assignee/Team:** FE Team
**Status:** Blocked
**Description:** Update `MarketplacePage` (`page.tsx`) and related components (`MarketplaceList`, `MarketplaceFilters`) to fetch data from the live `GET /api/influencers` backend endpoint via `influencerService`. Ensure live data renders correctly. Implement filter parameter passing to the backend API call. Handle loading and error states gracefully based on backend responses.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
    - Marketplace list displays live data from the backend/InsightIQ Sandbox.
    - Filtering UI correctly passes parameters to the backend API call and updates the list.
    - Loading and error states are handled correctly.
**Dependencies:** SPRINT1-BE-01 (API Implementation), SPRINT1-LEAD-01 (API Contract Sign-off)

**Ticket ID:** SPRINT1-FE-02
**Title:** Integrate Profile Page with Live Backend API
**Assignee/Team:** FE Team
**Status:** Blocked
**Description:** Update `ProfilePage` (`[id]/page.tsx`) and related components (`ProfileHeader`, profile sections) to fetch data from the live `GET /api/influencers/:id` backend endpoint via `influencerService`. Ensure all profile details (including contact info - Ticket 2.5) render correctly based on the live data and agreed contract. Handle loading and error states (e.g., influencer not found).
**Acceptance Criteria:**
    - Profile page displays live data for a valid ID from the backend/InsightIQ Sandbox.
    - Loading and error states (including 404 Not Found) are handled correctly.
**Dependencies:** SPRINT1-BE-01 (API Implementation), SPRINT1-LEAD-01 (API Contract Sign-off)

**Current Debugging Focus (2025-04-30 - RESOLVED & UPDATED):**
*   **Issue 1:** Profile page (`/influencer-marketplace/[id]`) rendered with excessive whitespace due to nested `ConditionalLayout`. **[‚úî RESOLVED - Removed inner wrapper]**
*   **Issue 2:** API route (`/api/influencers/[id]`) threw error due to incorrect async `params` handling. **[‚úî RESOLVED - Code updated & committed]**
*   **Issue 3:** Profile page showed "Influencer not found" error. Frontend calls `GET /api/influencers/:id`.
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** Was likely caused by Issue 2 (API error preventing data fetch) or potentially the backend logic not correctly fetching/mapping from InsightIQ yet.
    *   **Current Status:** With Issue 2 resolved, the API route *should* function correctly if the backend implementation (fetching/mapping from InsightIQ Sandbox) is complete and the ID exists in the Sandbox.
*   **Next Steps (Focus shifts to Implementation & Integration):** Now tracked via JIRA-Style tickets above.
*   **Goal:** Achieve a stable end-to-end flow where the frontend successfully displays influencer list and profile data fetched live from the InsightIQ Sandbox via the Justify backend API.

**Data Freshness Approach Note:**

*   **Initial Phase (MVP/Sprint 1+ - REVISED SSOT Approach):** Data will be fetched **directly from the InsightIQ Sandbox API** via the Justify backend **on every request**. InsightIQ is the SSOT. No intermediate DB storage or mock data. Data is as fresh as InsightIQ provides. Performance depends on InsightIQ.
*   **Future Phase (Post-Docs):** Introduce database caching/storage and implement webhook handler (`Task 3.4` in `refactor-insight-iq.md`) for asynchronous data updates, improved performance, and resilience.

## Projected Sprint 2: Frontend Integration & UI Buildout (Requires BE APIs)

*Goal Suggestion: (Remains relevant) **Connect the frontend Marketplace and Profile pages to the live backend APIs** hitting the InsightIQ Sandbox. Implement data display, filtering logic (client-side or via BE pass-through), and complete core standalone Marketplace UI (Filters, Profile sections).*\n
