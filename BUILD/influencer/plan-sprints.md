**--- PIVOT NOTE (2023-06-20) ---**
**Current Focus:** We are temporarily pausing the sprint progression outlined below to prioritize the critical refactoring required for the InsightIQ integration.
**Guidance:** The detailed technical steps for this refactoring phase are outlined in `BUILD/influencer/refactor-insight-iq.md`.
**Resumption:** Sprint planning and execution based on this document (`plan-sprints.md`) and the main `plan.md` will resume once the refactoring tasks (especially those blocked by InsightIQ documentation) are sufficiently addressed.
**Action Item:** Obtain `INSIGHTIQ_WEBHOOK_SECRET` from InsightIQ support (Needed for Task 3.4: Webhook Handler Refactoring).
**----------------------------------**

**--- DECOUPLING NOTE (2023-06-21) ---**
**Scope Adjustment:** Following the decoupling decision, the Marketplace will be developed standalone for the MVP. Tickets related to Wizard-Marketplace integration (original Phase 3: Tickets 4.2-4.5) are deferred post-MVP. Sprint goals and projections below are adjusted accordingly.
**----------------------------------**

Okay, as Scrum Master, with the detailed `plan.md` (now updated for **InsightIQ**) finalized and agreed upon, here are the immediate next steps to systematically break this down and get the development team mobilized:

1.  **Confirm Critical Prerequisite: API Contracts (Task Zero - REVISED FOR InsightIQ):**
    *   **Action:** ~~Immediately assign and prioritize **Ticket 0.5.1 (`CHORE(API): Define API Contracts (MVP)`)**.~~ **Revised Action:** Review available InsightIQ OpenAPI documentation (`openapi.v1.yml`) and **schedule FE/BE meeting to finalize and sign-off on Justify API contracts** (`GET /influencers`, `GET /influencers/:id`) based on it.
    *   **Why:** This remains a lynchpin. We cannot proceed with **stable** backend implementation or accurate frontend integration without agreed contracts based on InsightIQ's actual capabilities.
    *   **Owner:** FE Lead, BE Lead for sign-off.
    *   **Timeline:** ASAP.
    *   **Status:** **OpenAPI spec available (`openapi.v1.yml`), review & sign-off pending.**

**Definition of Ready (DoR) for Tickets:**

Before a ticket from `plan.md` can be pulled into a Sprint Backlog, it should meet the following criteria:
*   **Clear Requirements:** The Goal and Action steps are understood by the team. Any `TODOs` affecting the ticket are resolved.
*   **Dependencies Resolved/Planned:** Any blocking UI component dependencies (from Dep Checks) or API contract dependencies are resolved or have clear CHORE tickets planned.
*   **Dependencies on *other teams/services*** (if any) identified and communication initiated.
*   **Verification Criteria Clear:** The team understands how to verify the ticket is complete.
*   **Estimation Feasible:** The team feels they have enough information to estimate the effort (if using estimation).

2.  **Sprint 1 Progress & Next Steps (Updated 2025-04-30):**
    *   **Action:** Review **Phase 0 & Foundational Phase 1 tickets** from `plan.md` and the **refactoring tasks** from `insightiq.md`. **Wizard integration tickets (Phase 4 in plan.md) remain deferred.**
        *   **Core Setup & Refactoring (Largely Done):**

        *   **Backend Foundation (Focus on Direct InsightIQ Sandbox Integration - In Progress):**
            *   **(Refactored) Task 1.0/1.1 (`plan.md` based on InsightIQ): BE-FEAT: Implement GET /influencers & GET /influencers/:id routes:** ‚úÖ **(Implementation Done - Pending Testing/Deployment)** - *Logic implemented to fetch live data directly from InsightIQ Sandbox API, map response to Justify types, handle errors, accept basic filters.*
            *   **(Refactored) Task 1.9 (`plan.md` based on InsightIQ): BE-FEAT: Adapt Justify Score Calculation (Use Live Data):** ‚úÖ **(Implementation Done - Pending Testing)** - *Implemented V1 score calculation in `scoringService.ts` using live `InsightIQProfile` data (`is_verified`, `follower_count`). Integrated into API route handlers.*
            *   **(NEW/Refactored) Task 3.4 (`insightiq.md`): Implement Webhook Handler structure & logic:** ‚ùå **(Blocked by InsightIQ Webhook Docs)**
        *   **Frontend Foundation (Standalone Marketplace Focus - Ready for Integration Testing):**

### Immediate JIRA-Style Action Items (Sprint 1 Focus)

**Goal:** Achieve a stable end-to-end flow displaying live InsightIQ Sandbox data in the Marketplace List and Profile pages.

**Ticket ID:** SPRINT1-BE-01
**Title:** Implement Core Backend APIs with Live InsightIQ Sandbox Data
**Assignee/Team:** BE Team
**Status:** Done (Implementation Verified - Pending Final Testing & Deployment)
**Description:** Implement the core logic for `GET /api/influencers` and `GET /api/influencers/[identifier]`. Use `insightiqService` to call relevant InsightIQ Sandbox endpoints. Correctly map InsightIQ API responses to Justify types. Implement robust error handling. Implement filtering pass-through using the POST search endpoint body (including platform filter mapping; Added default platform ID for initial load). Implement V1 Justify Score calculation. Refactored profile lookup to use identifier + platformId. Deploy functional endpoints to dev/staging.
**NOTE:** Further testing/deployment blocked pending feedback from InsightIQ support regarding inconsistent data returned by the `/analytics` endpoint (profile mismatch issue).
**Acceptance Criteria:**
    - API routes return `200 OK` with correctly mapped data including calculated Justify Score for valid requests to InsightIQ Sandbox.
    - API routes return appropriate error codes (e.g., 401, 404, 429, 503) based on InsightIQ responses, using the standard error format.
    - Basic filtering (including platform filter) works.
    - Initial load (no filters) returns data (defaulting to Instagram).
    - Profile lookup using identifier + platformId works.
    - Deployed to dev/staging.
**Dependencies:** `openapi.v1.yml`

**Ticket ID:** SPRINT1-LEAD-01
**Title:** Finalize & Sign-off on Justify API Contracts
**Assignee/Team:** FE Lead, BE Lead
**Status:** Done
**Description:** Review the `openapi.v1.yml` specification **and the draft proposal in `insightiq-contracts.md`**. Schedule and hold a meeting to formally agree on the exact request/response schemas for the Justify backend APIs (`GET /api/influencers`, `GET /api/influencers/:id`) that the frontend will consume. Document the signed-off contract (update `insightiq-contracts.md`).
**Acceptance Criteria:**
    - Meeting held.
    - Final Justify API request/response schemas for core endpoints are agreed upon and documented/referenced **in `insightiq-contracts.md`**.
    - Sign-off obtained from both leads.
**Dependencies:** `openapi.v1.yml`

**Ticket ID:** SPRINT1-FE-01
**Title:** Integrate Marketplace List/Filters with Live Backend API
**Assignee/Team:** FE Team
**Status:** Done (Implementation Verified - Pending Final Testing & Deployment)
**Description:** Update `MarketplacePage` (`page.tsx`) and related components (`MarketplaceList`, `MarketplaceFilters`) to fetch data from the live `GET /api/influencers` backend endpoint via `influencerService`. Ensure live data renders correctly according to the finalized API contract. Implement filter parameter passing (aligned with current BE schema) to the backend API call. Handle loading and error states gracefully based on backend responses. Updated navigation to use identifier + platformId. Explicitly verify dynamic filter functionality end-to-end (including multi-platform UI, audience quality, score, followers, verified, search). Confirmed filter application only occurs on 'Apply Filters' click.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
    - Marketplace list displays live data from the backend/InsightIQ Sandbox.
    - Filtering UI correctly passes parameters to the backend API call and updates the list **only on apply**.
    - Loading and error states are handled correctly.
    - Clicking 'View Profile' navigates correctly using identifier + platformId.
**Dependencies:** SPRINT1-BE-01 (API Implementation - Done), SPRINT1-LEAD-01 (API Contract Sign-off - Done)

**Ticket ID:** SPRINT1-FE-02
**Title:** Integrate Profile Page with Live Backend API
**Assignee/Team:** FE Team
**Status:** Done (Implementation Verified - Pending Final Testing & Deployment)
**Description:** Update `ProfilePage` (`[username]/page.tsx`) and related components (`ProfileHeader`, profile sections) to fetch data from the live `GET /api/influencers/:identifier` backend endpoint via `influencerService` using identifier + platformId. Ensure all profile details render correctly based on the live data and finalized API contract. Handle loading and error states using structured error messages if provided by BE.
**NOTE:** Final validation blocked pending feedback from InsightIQ support regarding inconsistent data returned by the `/analytics` endpoint (profile mismatch issue).
**Acceptance Criteria:**
    - Profile page displays live data for a valid identifier + platformId from the backend/InsightIQ Sandbox.
    - Loading and error states (including 404 Not Found) are handled correctly, displaying informative messages.
**Dependencies:** SPRINT1-BE-01 (API Implementation - Done), SPRINT1-LEAD-01 (API Contract Sign-off - Done)

**Ticket ID:** SPRINT1-FE-03
**Title:** FEAT: Add Search Bar to Marketplace Filters
**Assignee/Team:** FE Team
**Status:** ‚úÖ Done (Implementation Verified - Pending Testing)
**Description:** Add a search input field to the `MarketplaceFilters` component. Connect this input to a new `searchTerm` state in `MarketplacePage`, deferring API call until apply. Update filter application logic (`handleApplyFilters`, `fetchData`) to include the `appliedSearchTerm`. Requires corresponding backend update (SPRINT1-BE-02). Added descriptive text for search scope.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
    - Search input field is present in the filter UI with helper text.
    - Typing in the search field updates the `searchTerm` state but does not trigger API call.
    - Applying filters passes the `appliedSearchTerm` to the backend API call.
**Dependencies:** SPRINT1-BE-02 (Backend Search Implementation - Done)

**Ticket ID:** SPRINT1-BE-02
**Title:** BE-FEAT: Implement Search Term Filtering for GET /influencers
**Assignee/Team:** BE Team
**Status:** ‚úÖ Done (Implementation Verified - Pending Testing)
**Description:** Update the `GET /api/influencers` endpoint to accept a `searchTerm` query parameter. Pass this term to the `insightiqService`. Update `insightiqService` (`searchInsightIQProfilesByParams`) to map the `searchTerm` primarily to the `description_keywords` field in the InsightIQ `POST /v1/social/creators/profiles/search` request. Update API contract documentation.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
    - API accepts `searchTerm` query parameter.
    - Backend successfully calls InsightIQ search with the term mapped to `description_keywords`.
**Dependencies:** InsightIQ API documentation for search filters.

---

**Current Debugging Focus (2025-04-30 -> 2025-04-30):**
*   **Issue 1:** Profile page (`/influencer-marketplace/[id]`) rendered with excessive whitespace due to nested `ConditionalLayout`. **[‚úî RESOLVED]**
*   **Issue 2:** API route (`/api/influencers/[id]` -> `/[identifier]`) threw error due to incorrect async `params` handling. **[‚úî RESOLVED - Signature Corrected Again]**
*   **Issue 3:** Profile page showed "Influencer not found" error due to identifier mismatch (username vs UUID). **[‚úî RESOLVED - Refactored to use identifier + platformId]**
*   **Issue 4:** List page showed no influencers due to InsightIQ search API requiring `work_platform_id`. **[‚úî RESOLVED - Added default platform ID workaround]**
*   **Issue 5:** Profile page API call resulted in scoring function warning (`Cannot calculate score for profile without ID`). **[‚úî RESOLVED - Scoring function updated]**
*   **Issue 6:** Profile page API call sometimes logs success for a different profile than requested (e.g., arianagrande -> Cristiano Ronaldo). **[üöß BLOCKER - Requires InsightIQ Support Response]**
*   **Issue 7:** Search functionality effectiveness limited by InsightIQ API's apparent lack of dedicated name/handle search field (using `description_keywords`). **[Mitigated - Focused query, Added UI description]**
*   **Next Steps:** **Thoroughly test Marketplace List page filters and search.** Await feedback from InsightIQ support on profile fetch inconsistency (Issue 6). Plan Sprint 2 including testing tasks and potentially implementing missing filters (Audience Age/Location) if blocker persists.
*   **Goal:** Achieve a stable end-to-end flow where the frontend successfully displays influencer list and profile data fetched live from the InsightIQ Sandbox via the Justify backend API. **[üöß PENDING - Blocked by Issue 6]**

**Data Freshness Approach Note:**

*   **Initial Phase (MVP/Sprint 1+ - REVISED SSOT Approach):** Data will be fetched **directly from the InsightIQ Sandbox API** via the Justify backend **on every request**. InsightIQ is the SSOT. No intermediate DB storage or mock data. Data is as fresh as InsightIQ provides. Performance depends on InsightIQ.
*   **Future Phase (Post-Docs):** Introduce database caching/storage and implement webhook handler (`Task 3.4` in `refactor-insight-iq.md`) for asynchronous data updates, improved performance, and resilience.

## Projected Sprint 2: Frontend Integration & UI Buildout (Requires BE APIs)

*Goal Suggestion: (Remains relevant) **Connect the frontend Marketplace and Profile pages to the live backend APIs** hitting the InsightIQ Sandbox. Implement data display, filtering logic (client-side or via BE pass-through), and complete core standalone Marketplace UI (Filters, Profile sections).*\n
