Meeting Notes: Discussion with Kelly Parkerson, Marketing Director at Paleo Valley
Introduction
On Wednesday, March 26, 2025, a meeting was held with Kelly Parkerson, Marketing Director at Paleo Valley, a U.S.-based company specializing in wholesome, homegrown food products. Kelly has been with Paleo Valley since 2020, overseeing a period of exponential growth with revenues increasing 50% year-on-year, reaching an annual revenue of $200 million. The connection to Kelly was established through Lydia Lee, founder of For The Clout (#FTC), whom I met at the Creator Economy Live conference in Las Vegas. The purpose of the call was to explore how Justify can better support Paleo Valley by understanding their key challenges and opportunities in influencer marketing.

Talking Points
Creator Economy Live Conference Insights
Kelly attended the Creator Economy Live conference in Las Vegas but found it overly high-level, catering to large corporate brands with substantial budgets. She described it as "ego fluffing" rather than practical, expressing a desire for insights into how mid-tier, up-and-coming brands succeed with scrappy, resourceful strategies.
Influencer Marketing Strategy
Long-Term Partnerships: Kelly prioritizes building enduring relationships with influencers, opting to pay fair, competitive salaries to the most effective creators rather than undercutting or offering poor deals. She noted that some long-term partners since 2021 have saturated their platforms with multiple brands, diluting their effectiveness despite large followings.
Effectiveness Over Metrics: She distrusts traditional earned media value (EMV) metrics, calling them "a load of pants" and unreliable for measuring true success. Her focus is on tangible outcomes over vanity metrics like impressions.
Content Engagement: Kelly emphasized the need for influencers to create engaging, effective content that drives action, not just eyeballs. She cited an example of a "good-looking man" who takes his shirt off, generating high impressions but negligible conversions, underscoring the importance of audience resonance over superficial appeal.
Podcasting and Tracking Tools: Paleo Valley leverages podcasting heavily, using tools like Podscribe to track listener IP addresses, linking them to website visits for greater transparency beyond coupon codes. She values podcasting’s educational potential and engaged audiences.
Retention and Conversion Challenges
Click-Through Rates (CTR): Kelly highlighted difficulties in correlating CTRs with actual purchases, particularly on Amazon, where tracking outside their ecosystem is complex. Retention is a key focus, with over 60,000 subscribers.
Sponsored Content Performance: She’s keen to analyze sponsored campaign click-through rates (excluding non-sponsored content) to assess purchasing power, validate influencer pricing, and measure ROI effectively.
Brand Collaborations
High-Profile Partnerships: A Joe Rogan podcast collaboration resulted in Paleo Valley’s most successful month ever, though its broad brand awareness impact is hard to track precisely. She views such macro-influencers as long-term brand plays.
Content Creation Approach: Influencers are given product samples and creative freedom to produce natural, organic content without scripts. However, Kelly lacks a robust way to test which messaging works best, identifying this as a gap.
Metrics and Tracking
Conversion Tracking: Paleo Valley tracks conversions on their bespoke website, but overlapping marketing efforts make attribution "fluffy" and imprecise. They aim to break even or profit on a set monthly revenue spend.
Influencer Roster: They maintain a list of approximately 3,000 influencers, with 250 actively engaged at any time.
Amazon Baseline: Kelly uses Amazon sales as a baseline to measure campaign spikes (e.g., post-Joe Rogan), though this method lacks granularity.
Political Neutrality and Brand Positioning
While Kelly is politically agnostic, Paleo Valley’s product line—emphasizing American-first, grassland-raised goods—appeals to a conservative audience, shaping their brand identity.
Influencer Campaign Insights
Budgeting: Campaigns typically cost $2,500, but there’s no cap if ROI is proven. Kelly prefers influencers who work selectively with brands to avoid audience fatigue from oversaturation.
Agency Relations: She despises agencies, feeling they overcharge and add no value, preferring direct influencer negotiations.
Advertising Spend: Paleo Valley invests $5 million monthly in Google Ads, prioritizing quality over quantity.
Retention Strategies: With 60,000+ subscribers, long-term partnerships and retention are central to their strategy.
Target Demographic: Kelly aims to shift focus toward females aged 45+ by the end of 2025, aspiring to make Paleo Valley a household name.
Podcast Collaborations
Megyn Kelly and Others: Kelly frequently mentioned a podcaster (possibly Megyn Kelly—needs verification) and values podcasts for education and engagement. She also referenced "Skinny Confidential" (to confirm).
Post-Purchase Surveys: A quick post-purchase survey reveals significant word-of-mouth influence, aiding acquisition insights.
Technology and Platforms
Current Tools: Paleo Valley uses Google Analytics, Podscribe, Sprinklr, Overflow, Mixpanel, Northbeam, Whale, and Monday.com, but Kelly isn’t tied to any and is open to switching.
Website Infrastructure: Their bespoke website (not Shopify) drives tool choices and complicates external tracking.
Platform Preferences: Instagram Stories is the primary influencer channel, TikTok is used for ads, and YouTube Shorts is under consideration.
Educational Content
Kelly places a "big piece" on creators delivering educational content first, building trust to guide consumers through the marketing funnel toward purchases.

Marketing Strategy
Influencer Outreach Process
Research: Her team invests heavily in researching influencers across platforms (Podcasts, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram), evaluating audience alignment, platform presence, and effectiveness.
Communication: Kelly insists on email outreach over social media DMs, as messages get lost in the latter. She wants direct email access to influencers.
Negotiation: Negotiations require detailed influencer data—background checks (e.g., controversial posts), follower authenticity (e.g., spam bots), past sponsored campaign success, prior brand collaborations, and effectiveness metrics.
Team Structure
Partnership Managers: Kelly oversees a team of at least 3-4 partnership managers who handle influencer relationships and campaign execution.
Business Partner: A new business partner, joining within 1-2 months, will focus on creator outreach and contract negotiations, targeting 300 new leads monthly.

Justify Opportunities
During the discussion, Kelly Parkerson outlined numerous pain points and wishlist items where Justify can provide tailored solutions to enhance Paleo Valley’s influencer marketing strategy. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of how Justify can address these needs, positioning itself as an indispensable tool.
Platform Features
Influencer Database: Kelly stressed the need for a centralized database with direct email contacts for influencers, streamlining outreach and bypassing inefficient social media DMs. Justify can offer a searchable, verified contact list.
Verification and Credibility: She seeks robust background checks—past controversial posts, follower authenticity (e.g., bot detection), and prior brand collaboration history. Justify can provide a credibility score, flagging risks and verifying professionalism.
Performance Metrics: Kelly wants granular analytics beyond EMV, including engagement rates, conversion rates, and sponsored campaign click-through rates. Justify can track the "halo effect" (aggregate campaign impact on brand perception) and individual campaign success, offering a "Justify Score" for effectiveness.
Campaign Management Tools: Tools for contract negotiation, content approval, and payment processing would reduce her team’s workload. Integration with Monday.com could sync with their workflow, while a payment portal eliminates agency middlemen.
Content Strategy Support: Kelly lacks a way to test messaging effectiveness despite valuing organic content. Justify can offer A/B testing tools or messaging analytics, identifying what resonates with Paleo Valley’s audience.
Data-Driven Decision Making
Audience Insights: To target 45+ females, Kelly needs influencer audience demographics and overlap analysis (e.g., a "spiderweb" approach linking related influencers). Justify can map audience alignment and recommend creators.
ROI Analysis: She craves precise attribution of sales and engagement to influencers, especially for Amazon and podcast campaigns. Justify can integrate with Podscribe and Google Analytics, tracking IP-based conversions and Amazon spikes against baselines.
Competitor Analysis: Kelly mentioned competitors like Chomps. Justify can provide insights into competitors’ influencer strategies, campaign performance, and market positioning, giving Paleo Valley a strategic edge.
Integration with Existing Tools
Tech Stack Compatibility: Paleo Valley uses Google Analytics, Podscribe, Mixpanel, and more. Justify can integrate seamlessly, pulling data from these platforms and their bespoke website to create a unified dashboard, addressing tracking gaps.
Influencer Relationship Management
Long-Term Partnerships: Kelly values enduring collaborations. Justify can track partnership history, performance trends, and saturation levels (e.g., brands per influencer), ensuring sustained effectiveness.
Direct Communication Channels: A built-in email system or verified contact portal aligns with her preference for direct, efficient outreach.
Spiderweb Recommendations: Kelly proposed a "spiderweb" approach to identify connected influencers via audience overlap. Justify can recommend creators based on shared followers and proven success with similar brands.
Freemium and Premium Model Consideration
Accessibility: Kelly supports a freemium model for initial brand access, with premium tiers unlocking deeper insights. Justify can offer basic features (e.g., database access) for free, charging for analytics, verification, and payment tools.
Tiered Insights: Influencers could pay to hide sensitive data (e.g., past campaigns), while brands pay for detailed reports (e.g., click-through rates, ROI). This aligns with her anti-agency stance, empowering direct dealings.
Robin Hood Value: Kelly sees Justify as a "Robin Hood" platform, leveling the playing field with verified data. Justify can market itself as a transparent, agency-free solution, appealing to her $5 million Google Ads budget and $2,500+ campaign flexibility.
Additional Opportunities
Educational Content Optimization: Justify can analyze educational content performance, suggesting creators and formats that best educate and convert Paleo Valley’s audience.
Podcast Precision: Building on Podscribe, Justify can refine podcast tracking, linking IP data to purchases and offering granular ROI insights (e.g., Joe Rogan spikes vs. baseline).
Retention Focus: With 60,000 subscribers, Justify can track retention metrics per influencer, identifying those who drive repeat purchases.
Competitor Benchmarking: Referencing Chomps, Justify can benchmark Paleo Valley against rivals, highlighting influencer gaps or opportunities.
Agency Cost Elimination: Kelly hates agency fees. Justify’s all-in-one platform—database, analytics, payments—cuts out middlemen, saving costs and aligning with her direct-deal preference.
Implementation and Next Steps
Kelly is "extremely excited" for Justify, requesting login credentials as soon as possible. A premium platform launch could target her wishlist—database, analytics, and management tools—while a freemium tier drives adoption. Integration with her $25 CPM Joe Rogan deal and 300-lead target (via the new business partner) positions Justify as a growth catalyst.
By addressing these opportunities, Justify can become Paleo Valley’s go-to solution, solving tracking woes, optimizing influencer ROI, and supporting their 2025 household-name goal.
