## 🎯 SSOT Compliance & Quality Assurance

### 🏗️ **SSOT Architecture Principles**

#### **1. Centralized Infrastructure**

- ✅ **All Cypress files** contained in `config/cypress/`
- ✅ **Zero scattered files** - comprehensive codebase scan verified
- ✅ **Single configuration source** - `cypress.config.js` as SSOT
- ✅ **Centralized reporting** - all reports in `config/cypress/reports/`

#### **2. Page Object Model Hierarchy**

```
config/cypress/support/page-objects/
├── index.js                 // ✅ Single export source (SSOT)
├── shared/
│   └── BasePage.js          // ✅ Foundation for all page objects
├── auth/
│   └── SignInPage.js        // ✅ Extends BasePage
├── dashboard/
│   └── DashboardPage.js     // ✅ Extends BasePage
├── campaigns/
│   └── CampaignsPage.js     // ✅ Extends BasePage
├── settings/                // 🔄 Phase 4: 5 new page objects
├── brand-lift/              // 🔄 Phase 4: 5 new page objects
├── admin/                   // 🔄 Phase 4: 4 new page objects

## 🆘 Troubleshooting & Help

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: Setup script fails**

- **Solution**: Check Node.js version (>=18), ensure package.json exists, run from project root

**Issue: Authentication command doesn't work**

- **Solution**: Verify API endpoints, check network tab for actual login request, update response handling

**Issue: data-cy selectors not found**

- **Solution**: Ensure attributes added to components, check for typos, verify elements are rendered

**Issue: Tests are flaky**

- **Solution**: Replace static waits with dynamic waits, check for race conditions, improve selectors

**Issue: CI tests fail but local tests pass**

- **Solution**: Check environment variables in CI, verify baseUrl configuration, check timing differences
