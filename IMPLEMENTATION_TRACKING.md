## Executive Summary

This document tracks the implementation of two critical solutions for the Campaign Wizard:

1. **Enum Format Transformation**: A comprehensive system to resolve mismatches between frontend enum formats (camelCase/TitleCase) and backend formats (UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE).

2. **Draft Saving Validation**: A robust mechanism allowing users to save incomplete campaign forms as drafts without validation errors at any stage of the wizard.

**Current Implementation Status**:

## Campaign Wizard Draft Saving Solution

After analyzing the validation errors encountered when saving partially completed Campaign Wizard forms, we've implemented a comprehensive solution that allows users to save incomplete campaigns as drafts at any stage of the wizard.

### 1. Root Cause Analysis

- **Problem**: When users try to save incomplete forms as drafts, validation errors occur because the backend expects certain data structures and object completeness
- **Specific Issues**:
  - Primary/secondary contacts being sent as `null` when they should be either valid objects or omitted
  - API validation schemas not distinguishing between draft saves and final submissions
  - Inconsistent handling of optional fields across the application
  - Influencer validation requiring handle and platform fields even for draft saves

### 2. Solution Architecture

We've implemented a robust, system-wide approach with these key components:

1. **Payload Sanitization Utility** (`src/utils/payload-sanitizer.ts`):
   - General-purpose utility for cleaning API payloads
   - Special handling for contact objects and other nested structures
   - Intelligent field omission that matches API validation expectations
   - Enhanced handling for influencer objects to prevent validation errors

2. **Draft-Specific API Validation**:
   - Created more lenient validation schema for draft submissions
   - Created separate `draftInfluencerSchema` for influencer validation during draft saves
   - Updated the campaign API route to use different schemas for drafts vs. complete submissions
   - Properly handled null/undefined/empty values in API route handlers

3. **Enhanced Form Submission Logic**:
   - Updated `handleSaveDraft` in all wizard steps to use the sanitization utility
   - Used conditional spread operator pattern to properly handle optional fields
   - Improved defensive programming with null checks and default values

4. **Consistent Pattern for All Optional Fields**:
   - For simple fields: `field: value || defaultValue`
   - For nested objects: `...(condition ? { object: { properties } } : {})`
   - For arrays: `arrayField: (array || []).filter(item => criteria)`

### 3. Implementation Details

1. **Created `payload-sanitizer.ts` utility** with these functions:
   - `sanitizeApiPayload`: General purpose data sanitizer that handles:
     - Removing null/undefined values
     - Removing empty objects and arrays
     - Preserving certain fields even if empty
   - `sanitizeContactFields`: Special handler for contact objects
   - `sanitizeDraftPayload`: Draft-specific sanitizer with more lenient rules
   - Added special handling for influencer fields in `sanitizeDraftPayload`

2. **Updated Step1Content.tsx** to:
   - Use conditional spread pattern for both primary and secondary contacts
   - Apply defensive programming with optional chaining and default values
   - Integrate the payload sanitization utility for consistent data handling

3. **Modified campaigns API** to:
   - Use a separate validation schema for drafts (`draftInfluencerSchema` for influencer fields)
   - Implement more flexible contact field handling
   - Ensure proper type handling for JSON fields
   - Add additional validation logic in the handler to handle draft vs. complete submissions

### 4. Testing Strategy

To verify this solution, we need to test:

- Saving completely empty forms as drafts (should succeed)
- Saving forms with just the name filled in (should succeed)
- Saving forms with partially completed contact information (should succeed by omitting incomplete contacts)
- Saving forms with empty/incomplete influencer information (should succeed for drafts)
- Saving forms at different wizard steps with varying levels of completion
- The ability to resume editing partially saved drafts

### 5. Key Technical Insights

- **API Contract Management**: Understanding that the Prisma schema expects either complete objects or no objects at all
- **Type Safety**: Ensuring proper TypeScript types throughout the sanitization process
- **Schema Flexibility**: Making validation schemas that distinguish between drafts and final submissions
- **Data Transformation**: Separating the concerns of validation, sanitization, and enum transformation
- **Defensive Programming**: Adding robust null checking and type safety throughout the codebase

This comprehensive approach ensures that users can save their progress at any point in the wizard workflow without encountering validation errors, while still maintaining data integrity and type safety.

## Campaign Wizard Draft Saving - Revised Implementation Approach

### 1. Implementation Error Analysis

Our initial implementation approach for the campaign API encountered a critical syntax error:

```
Expected ',', got 'as'
```

This occurred in `src/app/api/campaigns/route.ts` while attempting to modify the validation middleware to dynamically select different schema validation rules for drafts versus complete submissions:

```typescript
export const POST = withValidation(
  (request) => {
    const isDraft = request?.body?.status === 'draft';
    return isDraft ? campaignDraftSchema : campaignCreateSchema;
  } as any, // Type assertion needed due to dynamic schema selection - THIS FAILED
  async (data, request) => {
    // Handler code...
  }
);
```

**Why This Approach Failed:**
1. The `withValidation` middleware has a specific function signature that doesn't support TypeScript's `as any` syntax at this position
2. The middleware expects a schema as the first parameter, not a function that returns a schema
3. This approach attempted to modify the middleware's behavior without understanding its internal implementation
4. The application uses a custom validation pattern that isn't designed for dynamic schema selection

### 2. Revised Implementation Strategy

After analyzing the codebase patterns and middleware implementation, we've developed a more compatible approach:

1. **Use a Single Flexible Schema with Conditional Logic**:
   - Create a more permissive schema that can handle both draft and complete submissions
   - Use `.optional()` for fields that should be required in final submissions but optional in drafts
   - Add conditional validation using `.refine()` for context-dependent validation
   - Create separate schema definitions for draft vs. complete scenarios (e.g., `draftInfluencerSchema` vs. `influencerSchema`)

2. **Move Validation Logic into the Handler**:
   - Keep the schema definition simple and let the handler function apply different validation rules
   - Use explicit validation blocks in the handler for stricter validation when not saving drafts
   - Log detailed validation results for easier debugging

3. **Enhance Frontend Payload Preparation**:
   - Retain the payload sanitization utility for frontend data preparation
   - Focus on making the frontend send consistently structured data that will pass validation
   - Use defensive programming to handle all edge cases before API submission

### 3. Schema Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// Example approach for a flexible schema
const campaignFlexibleSchema = z.object({
  // Always required
  name: z.string().min(1, "Campaign name is required"),
  
  // Optional for drafts
  businessGoal: z.string().optional(),
  startDate: z.string().optional(),
  endDate: z.string().optional(),
  
  // Allow null or undefined for optional objects
  primaryContact: contactSchema.optional().nullable(),
  secondaryContact: contactSchema.optional().nullable(),
  
  // Different validation for influencers based on draft status
  influencers: z.array(draftInfluencerSchema).optional(),
  
  // Flag to indicate draft status
  status: z.enum(['draft', 'complete']).optional(),
});

// Route handler
export const POST = withValidation(
  campaignFlexibleSchema,
  async (data, request) => {
    // Check if this is a draft submission
    const isDraft = data.status === 'draft';
    
    // For non-drafts, apply stricter validation
    if (!isDraft) {
      const requiredFields = ['businessGoal', 'startDate', 'endDate'];
      const missingFields = requiredFields.filter(field => !data[field]);
      
      if (missingFields.length > 0) {
        return NextResponse.json({
          success: false,
          error: `Missing required fields: ${missingFields.join(', ')}`,
        }, { status: 400 });
      }
      
      // Additional validation for influencers in non-draft submissions
      if (data.influencers) {
        const invalidInfluencers = data.influencers.filter(
          influencer => influencer && (!influencer.platform || !influencer.handle)
        );
        
        if (invalidInfluencers.length > 0) {
          return NextResponse.json({
            success: false,
            error: 'Influencer data incomplete',
            details: { invalidInfluencers }
          }, { status: 400 });
        }
      }
    }
    
    // Continue with processing...
  }
);
```

### 4. Key Improvements

1. **Working Within the Framework**: Respecting the existing middleware pattern rather than trying to modify it
2. **Simplifying the Schema**: Using a single, more flexible schema that reduces complexity
3. **Context-Based Validation**: Moving complex validation logic to where context is available
4. **Better Error Messages**: Providing more detailed validation feedback for easier debugging
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Frontend handles data preparation, backend handles validation
6. **Schema Specialization**: Creating dedicated schemas for draft vs. complete submissions

### 5. Implementation Roadmap

1. Update `campaignFlexibleSchema` in `src/app/api/campaigns/route.ts` to be more flexible
2. Create separate schema definitions for complex objects (e.g., `draftInfluencerSchema`)
3. Modify the POST handler to apply different validation logic based on draft status
4. Enhance the payload sanitizer with special handling for influencer objects
5. Add detailed logging to capture the exact data being processed at each step
6. Test with different levels of form completion to ensure drafts can be saved at any stage

This revised approach maintains alignment with the overall plan while working within the constraints of the existing codebase patterns and middleware implementation.

### Latest Critical Fixes

#### Implemented Robust DateService for Date Handling

We implemented a comprehensive solution for date handling using the date-fns library:

1. **Root Cause**: 
   - Date objects were being inconsistently processed across different parts of the application
   - Specific formats like empty objects `{}` and non-standard date objects weren't properly detected
   - The way dates were saved differed from how they were loaded, causing display issues

2. **Solution Implementation**:
   - Created a centralized `DateService` class to handle all date-related operations:
   ```typescript
   export class DateService {
     static toFormDate(value: unknown): string | null {
       // Robust handling of all date formats (string, Date, object)
       // Returns YYYY-MM-DD format for forms
     }
     
     static toApiDate(formDate: string | null): string | null {
       // Converts form date to ISO format for API
     }
     
     static isValidDate(value: unknown): boolean {
       // Universal date validation
     }
     
     private static extractDateString(obj: any): string | null {
       // Extract date strings from complex objects
     }
   }
   ```
   - Updated `standardizeApiResponse` to use DateService for consistent date handling
   - Modified form initialization in Step1Content.tsx to use DateService
   - Updated all existing date formatting utilities for consistency

3. **Benefits**:
   - Strong type safety with TypeScript
   - Consistent handling of date objects across the entire application
   - Better error handling and validation
   - Improved diagnostics through detailed logging
   - Single point of maintenance for date handling logic

This solution ensures that the START DATE and END DATE fields correctly display after saving a draft campaign, fixing the previously reported issue.

#### API Date Serialization Fix

We fixed a critical issue with date serialization in the campaign API that was causing START DATE and END DATE fields to not display properly when loading draft campaigns:

1. **Root Cause**:
   - In the API response, Prisma Date objects were being serialized to empty objects `{}` before they reached our formatter
   - This serialization issue occurred in the NextJS API response pipeline, causing dates to be lost
   - The frontend received empty objects instead of valid date strings, resulting in blank date fields

2. **Solution Implementation**:
   ```typescript
   // In src/app/api/campaigns/[id]/route.ts GET handler
   
   // Process date fields before they get serialized improperly
   if (campaign.startDate) {
     if (campaign.startDate instanceof Date) {
       console.log('Converting startDate from Date to ISO string:', campaign.startDate);
       // Use type assertion to bypass TypeScript's strict checking
       (campaign as any).startDate = campaign.startDate.toISOString();
     } else if (typeof campaign.startDate === 'object' && Object.keys(campaign.startDate).length === 0) {
       console.log('Empty startDate object detected, setting to null');
       (campaign as any).startDate = null;
     }
   }
   
   if (campaign.endDate) {
     if (campaign.endDate instanceof Date) {
       console.log('Converting endDate from Date to ISO string:', campaign.endDate);
       (campaign as any).endDate = campaign.endDate.toISOString();
     } else if (typeof campaign.endDate === 'object' && Object.keys(campaign.endDate).length === 0) {
       console.log('Empty endDate object detected, setting to null');
       (campaign as any).endDate = null;
     }
   }
   
   // Also handle createdAt and updatedAt and any date fields in related objects
   ```

3. **Key Technical Insights**:
   - NextJS/Prisma date serialization issue: Prisma Date objects are not properly serialized by NextResponse.json()
   - The fix intercepts the dates before they can be improperly serialized
   - We explicitly convert all Date objects to ISO strings
   - We added robust handling for empty date objects
   - We extended the solution to handle dates in related objects (like Influencers)
   - We used detailed logging to track the date values through the process

4. **Technical Debt Considerations**:
   - Type assertions (`as any`) were necessary to bypass TypeScript's strict typing
   - A future enhancement could create a type-safe serialization utility
   - A more comprehensive fix might add a Prisma middleware to handle date serialization at the ORM level

This targeted fix ensures that all date fields are properly serialized in API responses, solving the issue of blank START DATE and END DATE fields when loading draft campaigns, while keeping changes minimal and focused on the exact point of failure.

#### Campaign UUID Validation Fix

We fixed a critical issue with campaign ID validation in the API routes that was causing "Invalid campaign ID" errors when navigating through the Campaign Wizard:

1. **Root Cause**:
   - The PATCH handler in `/api/campaigns/[id]/route.ts` was trying to parse UUID-format campaign IDs as integers
   - Modern campaign IDs use UUID format (e.g., `f2527c58-426a-4e6f-9b9d-7fe26a71bab5`)
   - Legacy campaign IDs used numeric format
   - The GET handler had proper UUID detection, but the PATCH handler didn't, causing validation failures

2. **Solution Implementation**:
   ```typescript
   // Before: Only supported numeric IDs
   const campaignId = parseInt(params.id);
      
   if (isNaN(campaignId)) {
     return NextResponse.json(
       { error: 'Invalid campaign ID' },
       { status: 400 }
     );
   }
   
   // After: Support for both UUID and numeric IDs
   const campaignId = params.id;
   
   // Check if the ID is a UUID (string format) or a numeric ID
   const isUuid = /^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$/i.test(campaignId);
   const numericId = parseInt(campaignId);
   
   if (!isUuid && isNaN(numericId)) {
     return NextResponse.json(
       { error: 'Invalid campaign ID' },
       { status: 400 }
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Database Operation Improvements**:
   - Updated the database operation to use the appropriate model based on ID format
   - For UUID IDs: Use `prisma.campaignWizard` model
   - For numeric IDs: Use `prisma.campaignWizardSubmission` model
   - Added proper relationship handling in both cases
   - Implemented consistent date serialization to prevent empty object issues

4. **Technical Debt Reduction**:
   - Made the ID handling consistent across all API operations (GET, PATCH, DELETE)
   - Added detailed logging to help with troubleshooting
   - Transformed response data consistently for frontend consumption

This robust fix ensures the Campaign Wizard can properly handle both modern UUID-format campaign IDs and legacy numeric IDs, allowing users to navigate through all steps of the wizard without ID validation errors.

#### Campaign Prisma Schema Mapping Fix

We fixed a critical validation error in the API that was preventing campaign updates due to schema mismatches:

1. **Root Cause**:
   - The PATCH handler was passing incoming data directly to Prisma without proper schema mapping
   - Frontend sends fields like `currency`, `totalBudget`, and `socialMediaBudget` as direct properties
   - The CampaignWizard Prisma schema actually stores these as a JSON object in a `budget` field
   - Similar issues with contacts and other complex objects caused validation errors
   
   ```
   Error: Unknown argument `currency`. Available options are marked with ?
   ```

2. **Solution Implementation**:
   ```typescript
   // Before: Direct pass-through of data (causes validation errors)
   updatedCampaign = await prisma.campaignWizard.update({
     where: { id: campaignId },
     data: {
       ...data,  // Contains fields that don't match the schema
       updatedAt: new Date()
     },
     include: { Influencer: true }
   });
   
   // After: Properly mapped data structure
   const mappedData: any = {
     // Map direct fields that match the schema
     name: data.name,
     businessGoal: data.businessGoal,
     updatedAt: new Date(),
   };
   
   // Handle budget as a JSON field
   if (data.currency || data.totalBudget || data.socialMediaBudget) {
     mappedData.budget = {
       currency: data.currency || 'USD',
       total: data.totalBudget || 0,
       socialMedia: data.socialMediaBudget || 0
     };
   }
   
   // Handle primaryContact as a JSON field
   if (data.primaryContact) {
     mappedData.primaryContact = data.primaryContact;
   }
   
   updatedCampaign = await prisma.campaignWizard.update({
     where: { id: campaignId },
     data: mappedData,
     include: { Influencer: true }
   });
   ```

3. **Advanced Handling for Relationships**:
   - Implemented separate transaction handling for influencer data
   - Added deletion of existing influencers before creating new ones to prevent duplicates
   - Properly mapped influencer fields to match the Influencer model schema
   - Added re-fetching of the campaign with updated relationships after modifications

4. **Benefits & Improvements**:
   - Robust adaptation between frontend and database models
   - Better error handling with detailed logging
   - Proper handling of complex nested objects and relationships
   - Support for both draft updates and complete submissions
   - Schema-aware data transformation for all incoming fields

This comprehensive fix ensures that campaign data can be properly updated through the Campaign Wizard interface, allowing seamless navigation between steps and proper data persistence regardless of the schema complexity.

### Latest Critical Fixes

#### Fixed Missing Influencer Data Issue
We identified and fixed a critical issue with influencer data not being properly loaded in the Campaign Wizard:

1. **Root Cause**: 
   - The Prisma query in the campaign API wasn't including the `Influencer` relation when fetching the campaign
   - The relationship between the `CampaignWizard` model and the `Influencer` model wasn't being connected in the API response

2. **Solution Implementation**:
   - Updated the campaign API endpoint (`src/app/api/campaigns/[id]/route.ts`) to include the Influencer relation:
   ```typescript
   campaign = await prisma.campaignWizard.findUnique({
     where: { id: campaignId },
     include: {
       Influencer: true // Include the Influencer relation
     }
   });
   ```
   - Enhanced the `standardizeApiResponse` utility to properly transform the Prisma `Influencer` relation to the frontend `influencers` field:
   ```typescript
   // Handle the Influencer relation from Prisma model
   if (result.Influencer && Array.isArray(result.Influencer)) {
     // Copy the Influencer relation to the influencers field expected by the frontend
     result.influencers = result.Influencer.map((inf: any) => ({
       id: inf.id,
       platform: inf.platform,
       handle: inf.handle,
       platformId: inf.platformId
     }));
     
     // Remove the original Influencer field to avoid confusion
     delete result.Influencer;
   }
   ```

#### Fixed Date Field Processing
We also resolved an issue with date fields not being correctly loaded and displayed in the form:

1. **Root Cause**:
   - Date objects from the API were sometimes coming back as empty objects `{}`
   - The form initialization code wasn't properly handling date transformation
   - The date formatting was inconsistent across the application

2. **Solution Implementation**:
   - Improved date handling in the form initialization code:
   ```typescript
   // Make sure startDate and endDate are properly formatted
   let startDate = '';
   if (campaignData.startDate) {
     if (typeof campaignData.startDate === 'string') {
       startDate = campaignData.startDate.includes('T') 
         ? campaignData.startDate.split('T')[0] 
         : campaignData.startDate;
     } else if (campaignData.startDate instanceof Date) {
       startDate = campaignData.startDate.toISOString().split('T')[0];
     }
   }
   ```
   - Enhanced the `formatDate` function to better handle edge cases:
   ```typescript
   const formatDate = (date: any) => {
     // Handle null, undefined, or empty values
     if (!date) return '';
     
     // Handle empty objects
     if (date && typeof date === 'object' && Object.keys(date).length === 0) {
       console.warn('Empty date object received:', date);
       return '';
     }
     
     try {
       // Handle Date objects
       if (date instanceof Date) {
         return date.toISOString().split('T')[0];
       }
       
       // Handle ISO strings
       if (typeof date === 'string') {
         // Extract date part if it's a full ISO string
         return date.includes('T') ? date.split('T')[0] : date;
       }
       
       console.warn('Unhandled date format:', date);
       return '';
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error formatting date:', error, date);
       return '';
     }
   };
   ```

These fixes ensure that both campaign dates and influencer data are properly loaded and displayed in the Campaign Wizard, resolving the key issues that were preventing users from picking up where they left off when editing draft campaigns.

### Code Implementation Highlights

```typescript
// Key improvements in standardizeApiResponse
export const standardizeApiResponse = (data: any) => {
  if (!data) return null;
  
  // Clone to avoid mutating the original
  const result = { ...data };
  
  // Process date fields
  ['startDate', 'endDate', 'createdAt', 'updatedAt'].forEach(dateField => {
    // Handle empty objects (common API issue)
    if (
      result[dateField] && 
      typeof result[dateField] === 'object' && 
      Object.keys(result[dateField]).length === 0
    ) {
      result[dateField] = null;
    }
    
    // Convert Date objects to ISO strings
    if (result[dateField] instanceof Date) {
      result[dateField] = result[dateField].toISOString();
    }
  });
  
  // Parse JSON strings for complex objects
  ['primaryContact', 'secondaryContact', 'budget'].forEach(field => {
    if (typeof result[field] === 'string') {
      try {
        result[field] = JSON.parse(result[field]);
      } catch (e) {
        console.warn(`Failed to parse ${field} JSON:`, result[field]);
        result[field] = {};
      }
    }
  });
  
  // Handle influencer array
  if (typeof result.influencers === 'string') {
    try {
      result.influencers = JSON.parse(result.influencers);
    } catch (e) {
      result.influencers = [];
    }
  }
  
  if (!Array.isArray(result.influencers)) {
    result.influencers = [];
  }
  
  // Ensure at least one empty influencer item
  if (result.influencers.length === 0) {
    result.influencers = [{ platform: '', handle: '' }];
  }
  
  return result;
};
```

### Lessons Learned

1. **Data consistency is critical**: We need to ensure consistent data structures between frontend and backend to avoid transformation issues.

2. **Safe parsing is essential**: Always implement safe parsing and fallbacks when handling JSON strings or complex data types.

3. **Centralize data transformations**: Using a dedicated utility for API response formatting helps maintain consistency across the application.

4. **Improve validation patterns**: Our validation schemas should be flexible enough to handle draft states while still enforcing rules for complete submissions.

5. **Enhanced debugging**: Adding detailed logs at key points made troubleshooting much easier and should be maintained.

6. **Form state management**: The complex interaction between context state and form initialization requires careful design and dependency tracking.

7. **Prisma relations handling**: When working with Prisma ORM, always remember to explicitly include related models with the `include` option in queries.

8. **Data transformation patterns**: Implement clear patterns for transforming data between different formats, especially when dealing with ORM relations.

### Future Recommendations

1. **API Response Format Standardization**: Consider standardizing all API responses to follow a consistent pattern for dates and complex objects.

2. **Enhanced Type Safety**: Improve TypeScript interfaces to better capture the structure of complex form data and API responses.

3. **Data Loading Patterns**: Adopt a more consistent pattern for data loading and state management across the application.

4. **Field Virtualization**: For large forms, consider implementing virtualization to improve performance with complex array fields.

5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Implement more gradual validation that gives better feedback as the user progresses through forms.

6. **ORM Relationship Management**: Develop a consistent approach to handling ORM relationships in API responses, possibly with dedicated utility functions.

This comprehensive solution has significantly improved the robustness of the Campaign Wizard, ensuring a smooth user experience when creating, saving, and editing campaign drafts.

#### Transaction-Based Campaign Creation
```typescript
// Create campaign with influencers using a transaction
try {
  // Use a transaction to ensure data integrity
  const result = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
    // Create the campaign first
    const campaign = await tx.campaignWizard.create({
      data: campaignData
    });
    
    // Create influencers with proper relation to the campaign
    if (data.influencers && data.influencers.length > 0) {
      for (const inf of data.influencers) {
        if (!inf.platform || !inf.handle) continue; // Skip incomplete influencers
        
        await tx.influencer.create({
          data: {
            platform: inf.platform,
            handle: inf.handle,
            platformId: inf.platformId || '',
            campaignId: campaign.id // Link to the campaign
          }
        });
      }
