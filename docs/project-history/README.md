# Project History

This section contains historical documentation about major project initiatives and milestones. While most developers won't need this information for day-to-day work, it provides valuable context about how and why the project evolved.

## Major Initiatives

- **[Unification Project](./unification-project/README.md)**: A comprehensive initiative to standardise the codebase, eliminate redundancies, and improve maintainability

## Purpose of Historical Documentation

These documents are preserved for several key reasons:

1. **Institutional Knowledge**: Understanding past decisions helps avoid repeating mistakes
2. **Context for New Developers**: Explains why certain patterns exist in the codebase
3. **Reference for Future Projects**: Provides templates and approaches for similar initiatives
4. **Technical Archaeology**: Helps when investigating legacy code or behaviours

## Using This Documentation

When referencing historical documentation:

1. Check the dates to understand the context and timeline
2. Focus on the reasoning behind decisions rather than implementation details
3. Recognise that current best practices may have evolved since
4. Use it to understand "why" something was done rather than "how" to do something now
