## Test Directory Structure
The new centralized test structure organizes tests by module type:

```
src/__tests__/
├── components/
│   ├── features/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── ui/
├── contexts/
├── hooks/
├── lib/
├── services/
└── utils/
```

This structure ensures:
1. Tests are consistently located and easy to find
2. Test organization mirrors the codebase structure
3. Better separation between tests and implementation
