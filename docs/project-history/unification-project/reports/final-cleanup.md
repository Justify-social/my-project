# Final Cleanup Report
Date: 2025-03-27

## Summary

This report documents the final cleanup steps performed to complete the unification project.

### Actions Performed

1. **Asset Migration**
   - Moved `icon-data.ts` to `scripts/consolidated/icons/`
   - Moved `icon-registry.json` to `scripts/public/ui-icons/`
   - Moved `icon-url-map.json` to `scripts/public/ui-icons/`

2. **Directory Removal**
   - Removed `scripts/src` directory completely

3. **Script Organization**
   - Moved cleanup scripts to `scripts/consolidated/cleanup/`
   - Added npm scripts for future cleanup operations

### Final Directory Structure

The `scripts` directory now has a clean, optimized structure:

```
scripts/
├── consolidated/  # All consolidated scripts organized by category
│   ├── build/
│   ├── cleanup/
│   ├── documentation/
│   ├── icons/
│   ├── linting/
│   ├── testing/
│   └── utils/
└── public/        # Public assets only
    └── ui-icons/
```

## Next Steps

1. Use scripts from their new consolidated locations
2. Run `npm run cleanup:deprecated` if any deprecated scripts are found in the future
3. Update any remaining documentation to reference the new script locations

## Conclusion

The scripts directory is now fully optimized and organized according to the unification project guidelines. This completes the final cleanup phase of the unification project.
