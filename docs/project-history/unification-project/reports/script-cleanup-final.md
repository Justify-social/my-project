### Preservation

The following script directories were preserved:
- `scripts/consolidated`: Contains all consolidated scripts
- `scripts/public`: Contains public assets

## Next Steps

1. Update any remaining documentation that may reference the old script paths
2. Verify that all automated processes use the consolidated scripts
3. Update CI/CD pipelines to reflect the new script structure

All scripts are now properly consolidated and organized in the `scripts/consolidated` directory, completing the unification process.
