# Performance Strategies & Considerations

**Last Reviewed:** 2025-05-09

This document outlines key strategies and considerations for optimizing the performance of the Justify application, focusing on bundle size, load times, and runtime efficiency, especially when deployed on Vercel.

## 1. Bundle Size Optimization & Tree-Shaking

Reducing the amount of JavaScript shipped to the client is crucial for fast initial load times. We primarily rely on Next.js's built-in optimizations.

### 1.1. Tree-Shaking via Next.js/Webpack

Tree-shaking removes unused code (dead code elimination) from the final bundle.

- **Mechanism**: Next.js uses Webpack internally, which automatically performs tree-shaking during the production build (`npm run build`).
- **Enabling Factors**:
  - **ES Module Syntax**: Use standard `import` and **named `export`** syntax. Avoid default exports for objects containing multiple functions if you want individual functions tree-shaken.
  - **`"sideEffects": false`**: Setting this in `package.json` signals to Webpack that modules generally don't have side effects, allowing more aggressive dead code removal. List files with side effects (like global CSS) explicitly if needed.
    ```json
    // package.json (Example)
    {
      "name": "justify",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "sideEffects": ["*.css", "./src/styles/globals.css"]
    }
    ```

### 1.2. Code Splitting & Dynamic Imports

Next.js automatically performs code splitting based on pages. We further optimize this using dynamic imports for components or libraries not needed immediately.

- **Mechanism**: Use `next/dynamic` to load components asynchronously.
- **Use Cases**: Modals, complex charts, rarely used feature sections, admin-only components, large libraries.
- **Example**:

  ```javascript
  import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

  const HeavyChartComponent = dynamic(() => import('@/components/features/reporting/HeavyChart'), {
    loading: () => <p>Loading chart...</p>,
    ssr: false, // Often beneficial for client-heavy components
  });

  function MyPage() {
    // HeavyChartComponent is only loaded when rendered
    return (
      <div>
        {/* ... */} <HeavyChartComponent />
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

### 1.3. Bundle Analysis

To understand bundle composition and identify large dependencies:

1.  **Install**: `npm install --save-dev @next/bundle-analyzer`
2.  **Configure**: Wrap `next.config.js` export with `withBundleAnalyzer` (see example in `docs/architecture/performance-optimization.md` or official Next.js docs).
3.  **Run**: `ANALYZE=true npm run build`
4.  **Inspect**: Analyze the generated HTML reports to find optimization opportunities.

## 2. Frontend Performance

### 2.1. Image Optimization

- **`next/image`**: Use the built-in `<Image>` component from `next/image`. It provides:
  - Automatic resizing and optimization.
  - Modern format delivery (e.g., WebP).
  - Lazy loading by default.
  - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) prevention (requires `width` and `height` props).
- **SVGs**: Use SVGs for icons and logos where possible. Optimize SVGs using tools like SVGO.

### 2.2. Font Loading

- **`next/font`**: Use the built-in font optimization (`@next/font/google` or `@next/font/local`) to automatically host fonts, prevent layout shifts, and optimize loading.

### 2.3. Minimize Client-Side Rendering & Hydration

- **Server Components**: Leverage React Server Components (RSCs) in the Next.js App Router where possible. Fetch data and perform logic on the server to send minimal JavaScript to the client.
- **`"use client"`**: Be deliberate about marking components with `"use client"`. Only use it for components that _require_ browser APIs or interactivity (state, effects).
- **Large Libraries**: Avoid importing heavy client-side libraries into Server Components. If needed on the client, pass data down or load the library dynamically within a Client Component.

### 2.4. Memoization & Preventing Unnecessary Re-renders

- **`React.memo`**: Wrap components in `React.memo` if they receive the same props often but are still re-rendering.
- **`useMemo` / `useCallback`**: Use these hooks to memoize expensive calculations or functions passed down as props, but use them judiciously as they have their own overhead.
- **State Colocation / Zustand Selectors**: Keep state as close as possible to where it's used. Use selectors with Zustand to ensure components only re-render when the specific slice of state they care about changes.

## 3. Backend & API Performance

### 3.1. Database Query Optimization

- **Indexing**: Ensure appropriate database indexes are defined in `schema.prisma` (`@@index`) for fields used in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN`s (via relations), and `ORDER BY` clauses.
- **Select Specific Fields**: Use Prisma's `select` or `include` options to fetch only the necessary data, avoiding over-fetching large objects.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination (`skip`, `take`) for queries returning large lists of data.
- **N+1 Problem**: Be mindful of potential N+1 query problems when fetching related data. Use `include` judiciously or consider batching data loading operations.
- **Connection Pooling**: Prisma manages connection pooling automatically.

### 3.2. Caching Strategies

- **Data Cache (Server-Side)**: Next.js App Router provides built-in server-side data caching (fetch Cache, Data Cache). Configure revalidation (`revalidate` option in `fetch` or page segments) appropriately based on data freshness requirements.
- **Edge Caching (Vercel)**: Configure Vercel Edge Caching via `Cache-Control` headers for static assets and potentially API routes serving non-personalized, frequently accessed data.
- **Client-Side Caching**: TanStack Query provides robust client-side caching for server state, reducing requests for already fetched data.

### 3.3. Serverless Function Performance (Vercel)

- **Cold Starts**: Be aware of potential cold starts for serverless functions (API Routes, Server Components). Keep dependencies minimal where possible.
- **Regions**: Deploy functions in regions close to your users or data sources.
- **Timeouts**: Configure function timeouts appropriately.

## 4. Monitoring & Measurement

- **Vercel Analytics**: Utilize Vercel's built-in analytics to monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) and general site performance.
- **Bundle Analyzer**: Regularly analyze bundle size (as described above).
- **Performance Profiling**: Use browser DevTools (Performance tab) and React DevTools Profiler to identify frontend bottlenecks.
- **Logging**: Implement structured logging (see `src/lib/logger/`) to track API response times and potential backend issues.
- **Database Monitoring**: Monitor database query performance (see `src/utils/db-monitoring.ts` if implemented).

By proactively considering these performance strategies throughout the development lifecycle, we can ensure the Justify platform remains fast, responsive, and scalable.
