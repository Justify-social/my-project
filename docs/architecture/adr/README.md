# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Last Reviewed:** 2025-05-09

This directory contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Justify platform. ADRs capture significant architectural decisions made during the project's lifecycle.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a short text file describing a significant decision related to the software architecture. Each ADR typically includes:

- **Title**: A short, descriptive title for the decision.
- **Status**: The current status of the ADR (e.g., Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded).
- **Context**: The forces and context surrounding the decision. What problem were we trying to solve?
- **Decision**: The specific architectural decision that was made.
- **Consequences**: The results and impact of making this decision (positive and negative).

## Purpose of ADRs

- **Record Keeping**: To provide a historical record of significant architectural choices.
- **Onboarding**: To help new team members understand the rationale behind the current architecture.
- **Communication**: To communicate architectural decisions clearly across the team.
- **Consistency**: To ensure architectural consistency by documenting the reasoning behind choices.
- **Avoiding Re-Litigation**: To prevent repeatedly debating past decisions by having the context and rationale documented.

## ADR Format

We aim to use a lightweight ADR format, often based on standard templates (e.g., Markdown ADR Template by Michael Nygard). Each ADR file should be named using a sequential number and a short descriptive title (e.g., `001-use-clerk-for-authentication.md`).

## Index of ADRs

_(This section should list all ADRs currently stored in this directory. As ADRs are added, update this index.)_

- **[ADR-001: Title of First Decision](./001-title-of-first-decision.md)** - Status: Accepted
- **[ADR-002: Title of Second Decision](./002-title-of-second-decision.md)** - Status: Proposed

## Creating New ADRs

1.  Copy an existing ADR file or use a standard template.
2.  Assign the next sequential number.
3.  Fill in the Context, Decision, and Consequences sections thoroughly.
4.  Set the Status (usually initially "Proposed").
5.  Submit the ADR via a Pull Request for discussion and review by the architecture team/tech leads.
6.  Once agreed upon, merge the PR and update the Status to "Accepted".
7.  Update this README file to include the new ADR in the index.
