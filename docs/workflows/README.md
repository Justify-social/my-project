## üöÄ Feature Development Workflow

### **1. Planning & Requirements**

#### **Feature Kickoff Checklist**

- [ ] **Requirements Clear** - Business requirements and acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] **Technical Design** - Architecture and implementation approach planned
- [ ] **Dependencies Identified** - External dependencies and blockers documented
- [ ] **Timeline Estimated** - Realistic timeline with buffer for testing

    D --> E[Implementation Start]

    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style E fill:#c8e6c9
```

### **2. Git Branching Strategy**

#### **Branch Naming Convention**

```bash
# Feature branches
feat/campaign-wizard-improvements
feat/brand-lift-survey-redesign

# Bug fix branches
fix/authentication-session-timeout
fix/database-connection-pool

# Hotfix branches
hotfix/security-vulnerability-patch

# Release branches
release/v2.1.0
```

#### **Development Branch Workflow**

```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/new-feature-name

# Regular commits during development
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication logic"

# Keep branch updated
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feat/new-feature-name
git rebase main

# Push feature branch
git push origin feat/new-feature-name
```

### **3. Implementation Standards**

#### **Development Best Practices**

```typescript
// 1. Type-first development
interface CampaignCreateRequest {
  name: string;
  budget: number;
  startDate: string;
  influencerIds: string[];
}

// 2. Test-driven development
describe('Campaign Creation', () => {
  it('should create campaign with valid data', () => {
    // Test implementation first
  });
});

// 3. Error handling
export async function createCampaign(data: CampaignCreateRequest) {
  try {
    // Implementation
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Campaign creation failed', { error, data });
    throw new CampaignCreationError('Failed to create campaign');
  }
}
```

    I --> J[Merge to Main]

    style J fill:#c8e6c9
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
```

### **Code Review Guidelines**

#### **What to Look For**

- **Functionality** - Does the code work as intended?
- **Code Quality** - Is the code clean, readable, and maintainable?
- **Performance** - Are there any performance implications?
- **Security** - Does the code introduce security vulnerabilities?
- **Testing** - Is the code adequately tested?

#### **Review Response Standards**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good review comment
// Consider using a Map here for O(1) lookup instead of Array.find()
// This will improve performance when dealing with large datasets

// ‚úÖ Good review comment
// Should we add error handling for the case where the user is not found?
// This could prevent runtime errors in production

// ‚ùå Avoid vague comments
// This doesn't look right

// ‚ùå Avoid only negative feedback
// This is wrong, fix it
```

## üêõ Bug Fix Workflow

### **Bug Triage Process**

#### **Bug Classification**

| Severity     | Response Time                  | Examples                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Critical** | Immediate (< 1 hour)           | Security vulnerabilities, data loss         |
| **High**     | Same day (< 8 hours)           | Major feature broken, authentication issues |
| **Medium**   | Next sprint (< 1 week)         | Minor feature issues, UI problems           |
| **Low**      | Backlog (when capacity allows) | Cosmetic issues, enhancement requests       |

#### **Bug Fix Implementation**

```bash
# 1. Reproduce the bug
npm run dev
# Navigate to affected area and reproduce issue

# 2. Create fix branch
git checkout -b fix/user-profile-update-error

# 3. Write test that reproduces bug
describe('User Profile Update', () => {
  it('should handle update errors gracefully', () => {
    // Test that currently fails
  });
});

# 4. Implement fix
# Make changes to make test pass

# 5. Verify fix
npm run test
npm run type-check
npm run lint
```

## üö® Hotfix Workflow

### **Emergency Response Process**

#### **Hotfix Criteria**

- **Security vulnerability** requiring immediate patch
- **Production outage** affecting all users
- **Data integrity issue** causing data loss or corruption
- **Critical business function** completely broken

#### **Hotfix Implementation**

```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/security-patch-auth

# 2. Implement minimal fix
# Focus on the specific issue only

# 3. Fast-track testing
npm run test:critical  # Run critical path tests only
npm run build         # Ensure build succeeds

# 4. Emergency deployment
# Deploy directly to production with monitoring

# 5. Post-hotfix actions
# Create follow-up tasks for comprehensive fix
```

### **Hotfix Communication**

```markdown
# Hotfix Notification Template

**üö® HOTFIX DEPLOYED**

**Issue:** Brief description of the critical issue
**Fix:** What was changed to resolve the issue
**Impact:** Who was affected and for how long
**Monitoring:** What metrics we're watching post-fix
**Follow-up:** Planned improvements to prevent recurrence

**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved
**Deployed:** 2025-05-23 14:30 UTC
**Team:** @dev-team @product-team
```

## ü§ù Collaboration Workflows

### **Team Communication Standards**

#### **Stand-up Meeting Structure**

- **What I completed yesterday**
- **What I'm working on today**
- **Any blockers or help needed**
- **Dependencies on other team members**

#### **Code Collaboration Best Practices**

```typescript
// 1. Clear commit messages
git commit -m "feat(auth): add two-factor authentication support

- Implement TOTP-based 2FA
- Add backup codes functionality
- Update user settings UI
- Add comprehensive test coverage

Fixes #123"

// 2. Meaningful variable names
const userAuthenticationStatus = checkUserAuthentication();
// Better than: const status = checkAuth();

// 3. Comprehensive documentation
/**
 * Creates a new campaign with the provided configuration
 * @param config - Campaign configuration object
 * @param config.name - Display name for the campaign
 * @param config.budget - Campaign budget in USD cents
 * @returns Promise<Campaign> - The created campaign object
 */
```
