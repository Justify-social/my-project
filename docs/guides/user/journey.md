  - Tabs or sections for managing different aspects (Assets, Audience, Settings, Reports, Brand Lift).

## 6. Setting Up a Brand Lift Study

## 7. Monitoring & Results

- Monitor data collection progress via the Brand Lift section or Progress Tracker component.
- Once data collection is complete and results are processed, view the Brand Lift metrics and insights, typically within the Campaign Detail page or the main Reports section.
