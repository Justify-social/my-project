**Last Reviewed:** 2025-05-09

Welcome to the Guides section. This area contains practical, task-oriented documentation answering "How do I...?" questions for various aspects of the Justify platform.

Guides are distinct from the conceptual explanations in `/docs/concepts/` or the architectural overviews in `/docs/architecture/`. They provide step-by-step instructions and best practices for specific tasks.

## Guide Categories

- **[Developer Guides](./developer/README.md)**: Instructions specifically for developers working on the Justify codebase. This includes contribution workflows, debugging techniques, deployment procedures, using specific systems like icons or testing, and guides for developing specific features.

- **[User Guides](./user/README.md)**: Instructions aimed at end-users of the Justify platform (e.g., Marketers, Agency Professionals). This covers topics like getting started with the platform, performing common tasks, and understanding user journeys.
