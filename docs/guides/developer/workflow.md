# Development Workflow Guide

**Last Updated:** 2025-03-05  
**Audience:** Developers  
**Complexity:** Intermediate

## Introduction

This guide outlines the recommended development workflow for the Justify.social platform. Following these practices will help ensure code quality, maintainability, and collaboration across the team.

## Development Lifecycle

### 1. Issue Assignment

1. **Select an Issue**
   - Issues are tracked in GitHub
   - Assign yourself to an issue or have one assigned to you
   - Ensure you understand the requirements and acceptance criteria

2. **Issue Preparation**
   - Discuss implementation approach with the team if needed
   - Break down complex issues into smaller tasks
   - Estimate the effort required

### 2. Branch Management

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   # Ensure your main branch is up to date
   git checkout main
   git pull
   
   # Create a new branch with a descriptive name
   git checkout -b feature/campaign-autosave
   ```

2. **Branch Naming Conventions**
   - `feature/` - For new features
   - `bugfix/` - For bug fixes
   - `refactor/` - For code refactoring
   - `docs/` - For documentation updates
   - `test/` - For test additions or modifications

### 3. Development Process

1. **Local Development**
   - Make small, focused commits
   - Write tests for your changes
   - Follow the coding standards

2. **Commit Guidelines**
   - Use descriptive commit messages
   - Reference the issue number in commits
   ```
   feat: implement campaign autosave functionality (#123)
   ```

3. **Testing Your Changes**
   - Run unit tests: `npm run test:unit`
   - Run integration tests: `npm run test:integration`
   - Run linting: `npm run lint`
   - Run type checking: `npm run type-check`

### 4. Code Review Process

1. **Preparing for Review**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Verify code quality with linting and type checking
   - Self-review your changes

2. **Creating a Pull Request**
   - Push your branch to GitHub
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/campaign-autosave
   ```
   - Create a pull request through the GitHub interface
   - Fill out the PR template with details about your changes

3. **Review Process**
   - Assign reviewers based on code ownership
   - Address review comments promptly
   - Request re-review after making changes

4. **Merging**
   - Merge only after receiving approval
   - Use "Squash and merge" for cleaner history
   - Delete the branch after merging

### 5. Deployment

1. **Staging Deployment**
   - Changes merged to main are automatically deployed to staging
   - Verify your changes in the staging environment

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Production deployments are scheduled weekly
   - Critical fixes may be deployed immediately after testing

## Best Practices

### Code Quality

1. **TypeScript Usage**
   - Use proper typing for all variables and functions
   - Avoid using `any` type
   - Create interfaces for complex data structures

2. **Component Structure**
   - Keep components focused on a single responsibility
   - Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
   - Use proper prop typing for React components

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for utility functions
   - Write integration tests for complex components
   - Aim for high test coverage on critical paths

### Performance Considerations

1. **Database Queries**
   - Optimize database queries to fetch only needed data
   - Use pagination for large result sets
   - Use transactions for operations that modify multiple records

2. **React Optimizations**
   - Use memoization for expensive calculations
   - Implement virtualization for long lists
   - Lazy load components when appropriate

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Git Issues

1. **Resolving Merge Conflicts**
   ```bash
   # Update your branch with latest main
   git fetch origin
   git merge origin/main
   
   # Resolve conflicts in your editor
   # After resolving, continue the merge
   git add .
   git commit
   ```

2. **Undoing Local Changes**
   ```bash
   # Discard changes in working directory
   git checkout -- <file>
   
   # Undo the last commit but keep changes
   git reset --soft HEAD~1
   
   # Undo the last commit and discard changes
   git reset --hard HEAD~1
   ```

### Build Issues

1. **Next.js Build Failures**
   - Check for TypeScript errors
   - Verify import paths are correct
   - Clear the `.next` directory and node_modules if needed

2. **Dependency Issues**
   - Ensure node_modules is up to date: `npm ci`
   - Check for conflicting dependencies
   - Verify you're using the correct Node.js version
