This directory contains detailed guides for developers working on specific, complex features within the Justify platform.

These guides go beyond the architectural overviews found in `/docs/architecture/features/` and focus on the practical aspects of development, customization, and troubleshooting for individual features.

_(Action: Feature Leads/Developers to populate this section with relevant guides as complex features are developed or modified. Examples might include: `campaign-wizard-custom-steps.md`, `brand-lift-kpi-calculation.md`, `influencer-discovery-algorithm.md`.)_
