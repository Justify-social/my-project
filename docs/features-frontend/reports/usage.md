**Solution:** Check that you've selected valid date ranges and campaigns with data. Some reports require a minimum amount of data to generate meaningful results.

### Missing Data in Reports

**Symptom:** Reports show incomplete data or missing metrics

**Solution:** Verify that data collection is properly configured for all channels. Some data may have a processing delay of 24-48 hours before appearing in reports.

### Export Failures

**Symptom:** Report exports fail or exported files are corrupted

**Solution:** Try exporting in a different format. For large reports, try reducing the date range or number of metrics to reduce file size.
