## Overview

The Justify.social platform is built with a modern, scalable architecture designed to ensure robust database integration, reliable autosave functionality, consistent UI styling, and type-safe API routes with comprehensive validation.

## System Components

The application consists of these core components:

### Frontend

- **Next.js Framework**: Provides server-side rendering and routing
- **React Components**: UI building blocks with consistent styling
- **State Management**: Context API and React hooks for state
- **Form Handling**: Custom form components with validation

### Backend

- **API Routes**: Type-safe endpoints with validation middleware
- **Database Layer**: Prisma ORM for database access
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Middleware**: Custom middleware for validation and error handling

### Database

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for structured data
- **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database client
- **Migration System**: Managed schema evolution

## Core Architecture Principles

1. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript typing throughout the application
2. **Validation**: Schema validation for all data entering the system
3. **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses and logging
4. **Monitoring**: Performance tracking and health checks
5. **Scalability**: Component-based design for growth

## Key Workflows

### Campaign Creation

1. User initiates campaign creation
2. Step-by-step wizard with autosave
3. Validation at each step
4. Database persistence with transactions
5. Final submission and status change

### API Request Handling

1. Request received by API route
2. Validation middleware verifies schema
3. Business logic processes request
4. Database operations execute
5. Standardized response returned
