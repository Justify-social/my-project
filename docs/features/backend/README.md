# Backend Features

This section documents the backend features, APIs, and services of our application.

## Overview

Our backend is built with Node.js and Express, using TypeScript for type safety. It follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns between routes, controllers, services, and data access layers.

## Key Technologies

- Node.js
- Express
- TypeScript
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Jest for testing
- JWT for authentication

## Architecture

The backend follows a layered architecture:

```
src/
├── api/                  # API routes and controllers
├── services/             # Business logic services
├── models/               # Data models and types
├── db/                   # Database access layer
├── config/               # Configuration management
├── utils/                # Utility functions
└── middleware/           # Express middleware
```

## API Structure

Our API follows RESTful principles with consistent URL patterns:

- Resource collections: `/api/v1/[resource]`
- Specific resources: `/api/v1/[resource]/[id]`
- Related resources: `/api/v1/[resource]/[id]/[related-resource]`

All API responses follow a standard format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "error": null,
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {}
  }
}
```

## Authentication and Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure HTTP-only cookies for token storage
- CSRF protection

## Data Storage

- PostgreSQL for relational data
- Redis for caching and session management
- S3 for file storage

## Error Handling

Centralized error handling with consistent error responses:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "details": {}
  },
  "meta": {}
}
```

## Backend Services

- **Authentication Service**: User authentication and session management
- **User Service**: User profile and account management
- **Data Service**: Core data operations and business logic
- **Notification Service**: Email and push notification delivery
- **Analytics Service**: Data collection and processing for analytics
