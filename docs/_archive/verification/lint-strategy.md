# Linting Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive linting strategy implemented for this project to ensure consistent code quality and maintainability.

## Goals

Our linting strategy aims to achieve the following goals:

1. **Type Safety**: Eliminate all `any` types in TypeScript code
2. **Clean Code**: Remove unused variables and imports
3. **React Best Practices**: Ensure proper hook dependencies and patterns
4. **Consistency**: Maintain uniform code style across the codebase
5. **Automation**: Integrate linting checks with Git workflow to prevent issues

## Tools & Infrastructure

### Core Tools

1. **ESLint**: Primary linting tool with TypeScript and React plugin support
2. **Husky**: Git hooks manager for pre-commit and pre-push validation
3. **lint-staged**: Runs linters on staged Git files

### Custom Scripts

We've developed specialized scripts to streamline the linting process:

1. **codebase-lint-cleaner.mjs**: Comprehensive scan and fix tool
2. **fix-specific-rule.js**: Focuses on fixing one ESLint rule at a time
3. **fix-unused-vars.js**: Automatically prefixes unused variables
4. **update-eslint-config.js**: Helps migrate to modern ESLint configuration

For detailed usage instructions, see [Linting Tools README](../../scripts/linting-tools/README.md).

## Implementation Approach

Our linting strategy follows a layered approach:

### 1. Preventative Measures

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Prevents committing code with linting issues
- **Pre-push Hooks**: Additional verification before pushing to remote
- **IDE Integration**: ESLint configured for real-time linting in editors

### 2. Batch Fixing

For existing issues or periodic maintenance:

- **Category-Specific Fixes**: Tools to address specific categories (e.g., `any` types)
- **Directory-Focused Approach**: Ability to target specific directories for focused fixes
- **Reporting**: Generates detailed reports to track progress

### 3. Verification

- **Lint Status Reports**: Regular reports in `docs/verification/lint-fix-progress/`
- **Audit Files**: Documentation of linting progress and strategies

## Prioritized Rules

While all ESLint rules are important, we prioritize fixing issues in this order:

1. **Parsing Errors**: Critical issues that prevent proper code analysis
2. **Type Safety**: Especially eliminating `any` types
3. **Unused Code**: Variables, imports, and unreachable code
4. **React Hooks**: Dependency array issues
5. **Accessibility & Performance**: Image optimization, a11y concerns

## Developer Workflow

Developers should follow this workflow to maintain code quality:

1. **Setup**: Ensure Husky is installed by running `npm install`
2. **Day-to-Day**: Let pre-commit hooks handle automatic fixes
3. **New Features**: Use IDE linting to fix issues as you code
4. **Periodic Cleanup**:
   - Run `node scripts/linting-tools/codebase-lint-cleaner.mjs` monthly
   - Check status reports and fix any systematic issues

## ESLint Configuration

Our ESLint configuration:

- Located in `eslint.config.mjs` (modern format)
- Includes TypeScript and React specific rules
- Has customized rules based on project needs

Key extensions:

- `@typescript-eslint` for TypeScript-specific rules
- `eslint-plugin-react` for React best practices
- `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` for React Hooks rules
- `@next/eslint-plugin-next` for Next.js specific optimizations

## Customization

The linting strategy can be customized:

- Adjust rule severity in `eslint.config.mjs`
- Modify `.lintstagedrc` for different pre-commit behavior
- Add directories to ignore patterns for specific scenarios

## Monitoring & Improvement

To continuously improve code quality:

1. **Regular Reviews**: Check lint status reports monthly
2. **Update Tools**: Keep ESLint and plugins updated
3. **Adapt Rules**: Refine rules based on evolving project needs
4. **Team Training**: Ensure all developers understand the linting strategy

## Conclusion

This comprehensive linting strategy provides both automated enforcement and specialized tools for maintaining high code quality. By following this approach, we ensure:

- Consistent code style across the codebase
- Reduced bugs through static analysis
- Improved maintainability through cleaner code
- Streamlined development with automated fixes
- Better onboarding through enforced standards

The combination of preventative measures, targeted fixing tools, and ongoing verification creates a sustainable approach to code quality that scales with the project.
