## Component Architecture

Our UI system follows atomic design principles, organizing components into atoms, molecules, and organisms. This creates a composable, maintainable architecture that scales with the application's needs.

## Component Libraries

We primarily use:

- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - Our primary UI component library
- [FontAwesome Pro](https://fontawesome.com/) - For icons (using our custom adapter)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling components
