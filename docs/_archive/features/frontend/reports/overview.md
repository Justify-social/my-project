## Troubleshooting

### Reports Loading Slowly

**Symptom:** Reports take a long time to load, especially for large date ranges

**Solution:** Try reducing the date range or applying more filters to limit the data set. For complex reports, consider scheduling them to run during off-hours.

### Data Discrepancies

**Symptom:** Report data doesn't match data from other sources (e.g., platform analytics)

**Solution:** Check the data attribution settings and ensure consistent attribution windows across systems. Verify that all data sources are properly connected and syncing.
