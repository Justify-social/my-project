## Best Practices

- **Diversify your influencer portfolio**: Work with a mix of micro, mid-tier, and macro influencers
- **Focus on engagement**: Prioritize engagement rates over follower count
- **Build long-term relationships**: Continuous partnerships often yield better results than one-off collaborations
- **Set clear expectations**: Document deliverables, timelines, and performance metrics
- **Regularly review analytics**: Monitor performance to optimize future collaborations

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cannot see all influencer metrics

**Solution**: Verify your subscription plan includes comprehensive analytics. Some metrics may be limited based on your plan.

### Issue: Influencer search returning limited results

**Solution**: Check your filter settings. Too many specific filters may overly restrict your results. Try relaxing some criteria.

### Issue: Unable to add influencer to campaign

**Solution**: Ensure the campaign is in draft or planning status. Influencers cannot be added to campaigns that are already active or completed.
