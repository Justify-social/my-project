# Frontend Features

This section documents the frontend features and components of our application.

## Overview

Our frontend is built using React with TypeScript and follows a component-based architecture. The UI is designed to be responsive, accessible, and consistent across the application.

## Key Technologies

- React 18+
- TypeScript
- Styled Components
- React Router
- Redux Toolkit
- React Query
- Font Awesome Pro

## Component Organization

Components are organized by feature and domain, with shared components in a common directory. This organization allows for better code reuse and maintainability.

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── common/                # Shared components used across features
│   ├── feature-one/           # Components specific to Feature One
│   ├── feature-two/           # Components specific to Feature Two
│   └── ...
├── hooks/                     # Custom React hooks
├── utils/                     # Utility functions
├── services/                  # API service layer
