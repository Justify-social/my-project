# Middleware Consolidation Report

## Summary

- API middlewares moved to dedicated directory: 0/4
- Files with updated imports: 0

## Changes Made

### Structure Improvements

- Created dedicated `src/middlewares/api` directory for API-specific middlewares
- Added README documentation for middleware organization
- Created centralized exports in `src/middlewares/api/index.ts`

### Moved API Middlewares

### Failed Moves

- ❌ `src/middlewares/validate-request.ts`: Source file not found
- ❌ `src/middlewares/api-response-middleware.ts`: Source file not found
- ❌ `src/middlewares/check-permissions.ts`: Source file not found
- ❌ `src/middlewares/handle-db-errors.ts`: Source file not found

### Files with Updated Imports

## Separation of Concerns

The codebase now clearly separates:

1. **Application Routing Middleware** (`src/middleware.ts`)

   - Handles routing, authentication, and authorization at the Next.js application level
   - Manages public paths and protected routes

2. **API Request Handling Middleware** (`src/middlewares/api/*`)
   - Handles API-specific concerns like request validation
   - Provides consistent response formatting
   - Manages permissions for API operations
   - Handles database errors

This separation follows best practices for Next.js applications and makes the codebase more maintainable.
