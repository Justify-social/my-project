# Script Consolidation Report

Date: 2025-03-27 (Updated)

## Summary

- 118 scripts initially moved to consolidated directories
- Script references updated in package.json
- Redirection mapping created for future reference at `scripts/consolidated/script-redirects.json`
- Fine-grained categorization performed using `reorganize-utils.js`

## Directory Structure

The scripts have been consolidated into the following directory structure:

```
scripts/consolidated/
├── build/        # Build, bundling, and deployment scripts
├── cleanup/      # Cleanup and maintenance scripts (9 scripts)
├── documentation/# Documentation generation scripts (8 scripts)
├── icons/        # Icon-related scripts (43 scripts)
├── linting/      # Code quality and linting scripts (3 scripts)
├── testing/      # Testing and validation scripts (33 scripts)
├── db/           # Database-related scripts (12 scripts)
└── utils/        # Utility scripts (10 scripts)
```

## Categorization Results

After running the reorganization script, the scripts were distributed as follows:

- **Icons**: 43 scripts related to icon management, validation, and migration
- **Testing**: 33 scripts for testing, validation, and verification
- **Linting**: 3 scripts for code quality and linting
- **Documentation**: 8 scripts for generating and managing documentation
- **Cleanup**: 9 scripts related to cleanup and maintenance
- **DB**: 12 scripts for database operations and migrations
- **Utils**: 10 general utility scripts that didn't fit into other categories

## Next Steps

1. Update any remaining imports in code that reference the old script locations
2. Remove original script files after confirming all references are updated
3. Add index files for each script category to provide easier access
4. Create thorough documentation for each script category
