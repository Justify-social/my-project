## Linting and Code Quality Detailed Plan

The Linting Improvements task involves comprehensive steps to ensure consistent code quality across the codebase:

### Automated Linting Fixes

1. **ESLint Auto-fix Implementation**
   - Run `npx eslint --fix "src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"` to automatically fix common issues
   - Update script in package.json: `"lint:fix": "eslint --fix \"src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}\""`
   - Apply auto-fixes in batches by directory to manage changes effectively

2. **Prettier Integration**
   - Run `npx prettier --write "src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,css,scss,json,md}"` for code formatting
   - Add script to package.json: `"format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,css,scss,json,md}\""`
   - Ensure Prettier and ESLint configurations don't conflict

### ESLint Configuration Enhancements

1. **Configuration Standardization**
   ```json
   // .eslintrc.json example updates
   {
     "extends": [
       "eslint:recommended",
       "plugin:react/recommended",
       "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
       "plugin:react-hooks/recommended",
       "prettier"
     ],
     "plugins": ["react", "@typescript-eslint", "import", "jsx-a11y"],
     "rules": {
       "react/prop-types": "off",
       "react/react-in-jsx-scope": "off",
       "@typescript-eslint/explicit-module-boundary-types": "off",
       "import/order": ["error", {
         "groups": ["builtin", "external", "internal", "parent", "sibling", "index"],
         "newlines-between": "always",
         "alphabetize": { "order": "asc", "caseInsensitive": true }
       }]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Custom Rules Implementation**
   - Add rules for enforcing consistent import statements
   - Configure naming conventions through ESLint rules
   - Add rules for preventing common React performance issues

3. **Configuration Documentation**
   - Create `docs/linting-guide.md` with detailed explanation of ESLint configuration
   - Include examples of proper code style and common fixes
   - Document how to resolve frequent linting errors

### CI/CD Integration

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**
   - Implement Husky for pre-commit linting: `npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run lint"`
   - Configure lint-staged to only check changed files: 
     ```json
     // package.json
     "lint-staged": {
       "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": "eslint --fix",
       "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,css,scss,json,md}": "prettier --write"
     }
     ```

2. **Continuous Integration Checks**
   - Add dedicated linting step in CI workflow:
     ```yaml
     # .github/workflows/lint.yml
     name: Lint
     on: [push, pull_request]
     jobs:
       lint:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - uses: actions/checkout@v3
           - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
             with:
               node-version: '16'
           - run: npm ci
           - run: npm run lint
     ```
   
3. **Pull Request Validation**
   - Ensure CI blocks merging PRs with linting errors
   - Add automated comments on PRs with linting suggestions
   - Track linting error trends over time

### Error Resolution Process

1. **Prioritization Strategy**
   - First fix critical errors that affect functionality
   - Then address warnings and style issues
   - Finally implement best practices and optimizations

2. **Common Issues Resolution Guide**
   | Issue | Resolution Approach |
   |-------|---------------------|
   | Unused variables | Remove or use variables appropriately |
   | Missing dependencies in useEffect | Add all required dependencies to dependency array |
   | Import ordering | Follow consistent import grouping pattern |
   | Accessibility issues | Implement proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML |
   | Inconsistent naming | Rename following project conventions |

3. **Automated Reporting**
   - Generate weekly linting reports
   - Track progress on error reduction
   - Identify patterns for targeted developer education

## Next Steps

1. Verify all changes with comprehensive testing
2. Document final structure and best practices
3. Conduct knowledge sharing sessions
