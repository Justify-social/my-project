# Reference Documentation

This directory contains technical reference documentation for the project. Unlike guides that provide step-by-step instructions, reference documentation provides comprehensive technical details.

## Organization

The reference documentation is organized into several key areas:

- [Architecture](./architecture/) - System architecture and implementation details
- [API](./api/) - API endpoints, parameters, and response formats
- [UI](./ui/) - User interface components and design system
- [Icons](./icons/) - Icon system documentation
- [Scripts](./scripts/) - Documentation for development and maintenance scripts
- [Configuration](./config/) - Configuration parameters and options

## Purpose

Reference documentation serves as the authoritative source of detailed technical information. It is typically consulted when:

- You need specific technical details about a system component
- You're looking for complete information about available options and parameters
- You need to understand the technical architecture or design of a component

## Using This Documentation

Each subdirectory contains documentation focused on a specific technical area. Start with the README in each directory for an overview of available documentation.
