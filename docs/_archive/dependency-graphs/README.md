# Dependency Graphs

This section contains visual representations of dependencies between different parts of the codebase.

## Available Graphs

- **[Component Dependencies](./component-dependencies.mmd)**: Shows relationships between key components

## How to Read These Graphs

These graphs use the Mermaid.js format to represent dependencies:

- Boxes represent individual components or modules
- Arrows show the direction of dependencies (A â†’ B means A depends on B)
- Dotted lines indicate weak dependencies or optional relationships
- Colours may be used to group related components

## Using Dependency Graphs

These visualisations help you to:

1. Understand the codebase structure at a glance
2. Identify potential circular dependencies
3. Find opportunities to improve code organisation
4. Plan architectural changes

## Updating Graphs

When making significant architectural changes, please update these graphs. You can edit the .mmd files using any text editor, or use tools like [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/) for visual editing.
