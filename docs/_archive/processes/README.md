# Development Processes

This section documents the development processes and workflows for our project.

## Overview

Our development processes are designed to maintain high code quality, ensure consistency across the codebase, and provide a smooth development experience for all team members.

## Development Workflow

1. **Issue Creation**
   - All work starts with an issue in our issue tracker
   - Issues should include clear acceptance criteria
   - Issues are prioritized in weekly planning meetings

2. **Branching Strategy**
   - Use feature branches for all changes
   - Branch naming convention: `feature/issue-number-short-description`
   - For bugfixes: `fix/issue-number-short-description`

3. **Development Process**
   - Make small, focused commits
   - Follow coding standards and conventions
   - Ensure tests pass locally before pushing
   - Update documentation as needed

4. **Code Review**
   - Create pull requests for all changes
   - Assign at least one reviewer
   - Address all comments and feedback
   - Ensure CI checks pass

5. **Merging**
   - Squash and merge to main branch
   - Delete feature branch after merging
   - Verify deployment succeeds

## Release Process

1. **Release Planning**
   - Determine features for next release
   - Set release date
   - Create release milestone

2. **Release Preparation**
   - Verify all features are complete
   - Run full test suite
   - Update version numbers
   - Generate release notes

3. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Perform validation testing
   - Deploy to production
   - Monitor for issues

## Quality Assurance

- **Automated Testing**
  - Unit tests for all new code
  - Integration tests for feature flows
  - End-to-end tests for critical paths

- **Code Quality**
  - Linting on all code changes
  - Type checking for TypeScript code
  - Performance benchmarks for critical features

- **Documentation**
  - Update relevant documentation with code changes
  - Document all new features
  - Keep API documentation up to date
