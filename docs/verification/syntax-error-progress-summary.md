# Syntax Error Resolution Progress Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the progress made on fixing syntax errors in the codebase.

## Progress

- **Initial State**: 13 syntax errors identified
- **Current State**: 0 syntax errors remaining
- **Progress**: 100% complete for syntax errors

## Resolved Issues

We successfully fixed all identified syntax errors across the following file types:

1. **React Component Files**:
   - Fixed improper JSX structure in `examples.tsx`
   - Fixed import statements in `StepContentLoader.tsx`
   - Fixed unused expressions in `CustomTabs.tsx`

2. **Next.js Special Files**:
   - Fixed function naming in 5 `not-found.tsx` files across different app routes 
   - Updated the function names from hyphenated to PascalCase format

3. **TypeScript Type Definition Files**:
   - Fixed interface naming in 3 wizard step type definition files
   - Updated the interface names from hyphenated to PascalCase format

4. **Script Files**:
   - Fixed template string issues in `deprecation-warnings.js`
   - Fixed misplaced import statements in `stray-utilities-consolidation.js`
   - Fixed code generation issues in `feature-component-migration.js`

## Impact

Fixing these syntax errors has:

1. Enabled ESLint to properly analyze all files in the codebase
2. Revealed additional errors that were previously hidden due to syntax errors
3. Improved the stability and maintainability of the codebase

## Next Steps

While syntax errors are completely resolved (0 remaining), there are still other ESLint issues to address:

- Total ESLint Issues: 14,187 problems (12,825 errors, 1,362 warnings)
- Primary focus should now be on:
  - `@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports` (282 errors)
  - `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-expressions` (8 errors)

## Recommendations

1. Implement pre-commit linting hooks to prevent syntax errors from entering the codebase
2. Ensure all developers understand JavaScript/TypeScript naming conventions
3. Add automated testing for syntax validity in CI/CD pipelines
4. Consider using the ESLint autofix capabilities for resolving additional issues
