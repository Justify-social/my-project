## Core Documentation Principles

Our documentation aims to follow these principles:

1.  **Single Source of Truth (SSOT):** Each topic should have exactly one authoritative document. Avoid duplication; link to existing documents instead.
2.  **Simple Language:** Explain complex concepts in plain terms, favouring clarity over technical jargon. Use British English spelling and grammar where natural.
3.  **Consistent Structure:** Documents should follow a predictable organisation, making information easier to find.
4.  **Developer-First:** Organise content around developer needs, workflows, and common tasks.
