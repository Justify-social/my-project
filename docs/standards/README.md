# Project Standards & Conventions

**Last Reviewed:** 2025-05-09

This section defines the definitive rules, standards, and conventions that all developers must adhere to when working on the Justify codebase. Following these standards ensures consistency, maintainability, quality, and a smoother development experience for everyone.

These are not just guidelines; they are the agreed-upon rules for the project.

## Index of Standards

- **[Code Standards](./code-standards.md)**: _(To be recreated)_ High-level principles and core coding standards for TypeScript, React, CSS, etc. (Excludes tool-specific linting/formatting rules).
- **[Naming Conventions](./naming-conventions.md)**: _(To be recreated)_ SSOT for naming files, directories, variables, components, functions, types, etc.
- **[Linting & Formatting](./linting-formatting.md)**: _(To be created)_ SSOT defining the specific ESLint and Prettier rules used, how they are configured, and how to run them.
- **[Testing Strategy](./testing-strategy.md)**: _(To be recreated)_ SSOT defining our approach to unit, integration, and end-to-end testing, including tools used and expectations for test coverage.
- **[API Design Guidelines](./api-design.md)**: _(Placeholder)_ Standards for designing consistent, predictable, and robust internal APIs (Next.js API Routes).
- **[Commit Messages](./commit-messages.md)**: _(Placeholder)_ Definition and examples of the Conventional Commits standard required for all commit messages.
- **[Accessibility (a11y)](./accessibility.md)**: _(Placeholder)_ Specific accessibility guidelines, target WCAG levels, and best practices to follow.
- **[Security](./security.md)**: _(Placeholder)_ Secure coding practices, dependency management policies, and links to other security resources (like root `SECURITY.md`).

Adherence to these standards is expected in all contributions and will be checked during code reviews.
