# Security Standards & Best Practices

**Last Reviewed:** 2025-05-09

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the security standards, guidelines, and best practices to be followed during the development and operation of the Justify platform. Security is a critical concern, and adherence to these standards is mandatory.

This document complements the root `SECURITY.md` file (which typically contains reporting procedures for vulnerabilities) by detailing proactive development practices.

_(Action: Security Lead/Tech Lead to populate this document with specific standards, procedures, and tool recommendations.)_

## 2. Core Principles

- **Defense in Depth:** Employ multiple layers of security controls.
- **Least Privilege:** Grant users and processes only the minimum permissions necessary.
- **Secure by Design:** Consider security implications throughout the development lifecycle.
- **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update libraries and frameworks to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Validate All Inputs:** Never trust user input or data from external systems.
- **Fail Securely:** Ensure failures do not leave the system in an insecure state.

## 3. Authentication & Authorization

- **Provider:** Utilize Clerk as the primary authentication provider (See **[Authentication Architecture](../architecture/authentication.md)**).
- **Session Management:** Rely on Clerk's secure session management.
- **Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies via Clerk settings.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Encourage or enforce MFA via Clerk settings.
- **Authorization Checks:** Implement explicit authorization checks in API routes and server-side logic based on user roles or permissions derived from `sessionClaims` or the application database. Do not rely solely on hiding UI elements.

## 4. Input Validation & Output Encoding

- **Input Validation:** Validate _all_ incoming data (request bodies, query parameters, path parameters) on the server-side, typically in API routes, using Zod schemas.
- **Output Encoding:** Ensure data rendered in the frontend (React) is properly encoded to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). React largely handles this by default, but be cautious when using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- **SQL Injection:** Prevented by using Prisma ORM, which parameterizes queries. Avoid constructing raw SQL queries with user input.

## 5. Dependency Management

- **Regular Updates:** Regularly update dependencies (`npm update` or `pnpm update`) to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Utilize tools like `npm audit`, `pnpm audit`, Snyk, or GitHub Dependabot alerts to automatically scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- **Review Dependencies:** Be cautious when adding new dependencies. Evaluate their security posture and maintenance status.

## 6. API Security

- **HTTPS:** Ensure all communication is over HTTPS (handled by Vercel deployment).
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on critical API endpoints to prevent abuse (potentially via Vercel Edge Middleware or backend logic).
- **CSRF Protection:** Next.js generally provides some protection, but ensure critical state-changing requests (POST, PUT, DELETE) are properly secured, especially if using custom form handling or non-standard API patterns.
- **Authentication/Authorization:** As mentioned above, ensure all relevant API routes are protected.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Avoid sending excessive or sensitive data in API responses.

## 7. Secrets Management

- **Environment Variables:** Store all secrets (API keys, database URLs, JWT secrets) in environment variables (`.env.local`, Vercel Environment Variables). **Never commit secrets to Git.**
- **Access Control:** Restrict access to production environment variables in Vercel.

## 8. Secure Coding Practices

- Follow guidelines from resources like OWASP Top 10.
- Sanitize inputs, validate outputs.
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information.
- Be mindful of potential race conditions or insecure state transitions.

## 9. Infrastructure & Deployment (Vercel)

- Leverage Vercel's built-in security features.
- Configure security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy - CSP, HSTS) if necessary beyond Vercel defaults.
- Regularly review Vercel project settings and permissions.

## 10. Incident Response (High-Level)

- Refer to the root `SECURITY.md` for procedures on reporting suspected vulnerabilities.
- _(Action: Define internal incident response plan if necessary.)_

Security is an ongoing process. Regularly review these standards and stay informed about new threats and best practices.
