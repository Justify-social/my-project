# Security Standards & Best Practices

**Last Reviewed:** 2025-05-08

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the security standards, guidelines, and best practices to be followed during the development and operation of the Justify platform. Security is a critical concern, and adherence to these standards is mandatory for all contributors.

This document complements the root [`SECURITY.md`](./../../../SECURITY.md) file, which contains procedures for reporting suspected vulnerabilities, by detailing proactive development and operational practices.

## 2. Core Principles

- **Secure by Design:** Security considerations must be integrated into all phases of the development lifecycle, from design to deployment and maintenance.
- **Defense in Depth:** Employ multiple layers of security controls (e.g., input validation, authentication, authorization, network security, infrastructure hardening).
- **Least Privilege:** Grant users, services, and processes only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their intended functions.
- **Keep Systems Updated:** Regularly update dependencies, frameworks, operating systems, and infrastructure components to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Validate All Inputs:** Never trust user input or data from external systems. Validate data at the point of entry.
- **Fail Securely:** Ensure that application failures do not leave the system or data in an insecure state.
- **Protect Data:** Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (HTTPS) and at rest where appropriate.

## 3. Authentication & Authorization

- **Provider:** Clerk is the standard authentication provider. Rely on its features for secure user management, session handling, and password policies. See **[Authentication Architecture](../architecture/authentication.md)**.
- **MFA:** Multi-Factor Authentication should be encouraged or enforced for users via Clerk settings.
- **API Route Protection:** All API routes requiring authentication MUST be protected using Clerk middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) or explicit checks using `auth()` within the handler.
- **Authorization Logic:** Implement explicit authorization checks within API handlers or dedicated middleware. Verify that the authenticated user (`userId`, `orgId`) has the necessary permissions (e.g., role-based, ownership-based) for the requested resource and action. **Do not rely solely on hiding UI elements for authorization.**

## 4. Input Validation & Output Encoding

- **Input Validation:**
  - Mandatory server-side validation of **all** inputs (request bodies, query parameters, path parameters) using Zod schemas. See **[API Design Standards](./api-design.md)**.
  - Validate data type, format, length, and range as strictly as possible.
- **Output Encoding:**
  - React handles HTML encoding by default, preventing most common XSS vulnerabilities. Avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary and the input is properly sanitized/trusted.
  - Ensure API responses correctly set `Content-Type: application/json` (handled by `NextResponse.json()`) to prevent content-sniffing attacks.
- **SQL Injection:** Prevented by using the Prisma ORM, which uses parameterized queries. **Do not** construct raw SQL queries using unvalidated user input.

## 5. Dependency Management

- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using `npm audit` or `pnpm audit`. Integrate automated scanning (e.g., GitHub Dependabot alerts, Snyk) into the CI/CD pipeline and development workflow.
- **Regular Updates:** Keep dependencies reasonably up-to-date. Prioritize patching high-severity vulnerabilities promptly.
- **Review Dependencies:** Exercise caution when adding new dependencies. Evaluate their maintenance status, popularity, security track record, and the necessity of adding them.

## 6. API Security

- **HTTPS:** All API communication MUST occur over HTTPS (enforced by Vercel deployment).
- **Authentication/Authorization:** As per Section 3, ensure all endpoints are appropriately protected.
- **Input Validation:** As per Section 4.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on sensitive or computationally expensive API endpoints to prevent denial-of-service and brute-force attacks. This can potentially be configured via Vercel Edge Middleware or custom backend logic.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Design API responses to expose only the necessary data. Avoid leaking internal implementation details or excessive user information.
- **CORS:** Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies appropriately if APIs need to be accessed from different origins. Use specific origins rather than wildcard (`*`) where possible. (Check Vercel or `next.config.js` for configuration).

## 7. Secrets Management

- **Storage:** Store all secrets (API keys, database credentials, JWT secrets, webhook secrets) exclusively in environment variables.
- **Environment Files:** Use `.env.local` for local development secrets. **Never commit `.env.local` or files containing secrets directly to the Git repository.**
- **Production Secrets:** Manage production secrets securely using Vercel Environment Variables.
- **Access Control:** Limit access to production environment variables in Vercel to authorized personnel.
- **Leakage Prevention:** Ensure secrets are not logged or exposed in client-side code or error messages. Utilize logging practices that redact or omit secrets (as observed in `server-config.ts` and `api-verification.ts`).

## 8. Secure Coding Practices

- **OWASP Top 10:** Be familiar with and code defensively against common web vulnerabilities outlined in the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling that logs detailed diagnostic information server-side but returns generic, non-revealing error messages to the client (as facilitated by `handleApiError`).
- **Least Privilege (Code):** Ensure application logic operates with the minimum necessary permissions.
- **Code Reviews:** Incorporate security considerations into code reviews.

## 9. Infrastructure & Deployment (Vercel)

- **Leverage Platform Features:** Utilize Vercel's built-in security features (automatic HTTPS, DDoS protection, secure environment variables).
- **Security Headers:** Review and configure essential security headers via Vercel settings or `next.config.js` headers if defaults are insufficient. Recommended headers include:
  - `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS): Enforces HTTPS. Example: `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`
  - `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP): Mitigates XSS. Requires careful configuration based on application needs. Start with a restrictive policy and allow necessary sources.
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`: Prevents MIME-sniffing attacks.
  - `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` or `DENY`: Protects against clickjacking.
  - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` or stricter.
- **Permissions:** Regularly review access permissions within the Vercel project.

## 10. Incident Response

- **Vulnerability Reporting:** External parties should follow the instructions in the root [`SECURITY.md`](./../../../SECURITY.md) file to report suspected vulnerabilities.
- **Internal Process:** _(Placeholder: Define the internal process for handling reported vulnerabilities, including triage, patching, and communication.)_

Security is an ongoing process requiring vigilance from the entire team. Regularly review these standards, stay informed about emerging threats, and incorporate security thinking into daily development activities.
