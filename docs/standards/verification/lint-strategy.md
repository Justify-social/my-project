# Linting Strategy

This document outlines our comprehensive approach to code quality verification through linting.

## Core Principles

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Address critical issues first, then move to less critical ones
2. **Automated Remediation**: Automate fixes where possible
3. **Documentation**: Keep track of manual fixes and patterns
4. **Consistency**: Apply the same standards across the entire codebase

## Linting Tools

We use a combination of tools for comprehensive code quality verification:

- **ESLint**: JavaScript/TypeScript syntax and style checking
- **TypeScript Compiler**: Type checking
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **Custom Scripts**: Special-purpose linting for project-specific conventions

## Issue Prioritization

Issues are categorized by severity:

1. **Critical**: Errors that cause runtime crashes or incorrect behavior
2. **Major**: Type errors, improper hook usage, memory leaks
3. **Minor**: Style issues, naming convention violations
4. **Trivial**: Documentation, comments, whitespace

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Syntax Error Fixes

1. Address all syntax errors that prevent compilation
2. Fix critical TypeScript errors
3. Document patterns for later bulk fixing

### Phase 2: Bulk Fixes

1. Create automated scripts for common issues
2. Apply bulk fixes for consistent patterns
3. Verify fixes don't introduce new issues

### Phase 3: Specialized Fixes

1. Address complex issues requiring manual intervention
2. Handle edge cases and special patterns
3. Implement more sophisticated automated fixes

### Phase 4: Standardization

1. Enforce consistent naming conventions
2. Enforce consistent file structure
3. Enforce consistent API patterns

## Tracking Progress

Progress is tracked in:

1. **Consolidated Lint Report**: Overall statistics and trends
2. **Issue Logs**: Specific issues and their resolution status
3. **Progress Reports**: Regular updates on linting progress
