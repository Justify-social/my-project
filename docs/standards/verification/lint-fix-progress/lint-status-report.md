# Lint Status Report - April 5, 2024

## Current Status

**Issues Remaining:** 597
- **Errors:** 46 (reduced from 47)
- **Warnings:** 551 (increased from 547)

## Critical Issues

The most serious issues that need to be addressed are:

1. **Parsing Errors (8 files with critical errors):** 
   - We've fixed the parsing errors in `Step1Content.tsx` and `Step3Content.tsx` by correcting double `if` statements
   - Remaining parsing errors in these files:
     - `Step4Content.tsx`
     - `Step5Content.tsx`
     - `CalendarUpcoming.tsx`
     - `ui/custom-tabs.tsx`
     - `ui/date-picker/DatePicker.tsx`
     - `ui/examples.tsx`
     - `ui/icons/core/SvgIcon.tsx`
     - `ui/icons/test/IconTester.tsx`
     - `ui/table.tsx`
     - `ui/layout/Table.tsx`
     - `lib/api-verification.ts`
     - `components/upload/CampaignAssetUploader.tsx`
     - `components/upload/EnhancedAssetPreview.tsx`

2. **Empty Object Type (1 issue):** 
   - `src/types/routes.ts:8:27` - Replace with more specific type like `object` or `unknown`

3. **HTML Link Issues (2 files):**
   - `client-layout.example.tsx` - Using `<a>` instead of Next.js `<Link>`

## Common Warnings

The most common warnings that should be addressed:

1. **Unused Variables and Imports (391 instances):**
   - Variables/imports defined but never used
   - Fix by prefixing with underscore (e.g., `_myUnusedVar`) or removing

2. **Explicit 'any' Type (74 instances):**
   - Using `any` type instead of more specific types
   - Replace with more precise types like `unknown`, `Record<string, unknown>`, etc.

3. **Next.js Image Issues (16 instances):**
   - Using HTML `<img>` tags instead of Next.js `<Image>` component
   - Replace with `<Image>` from 'next/image'

4. **React Hook Dependencies (5 instances):**
   - Missing dependencies in React hook dependency arrays
   - Add missing dependencies or restructure code

## Automation Progress

The current Husky setup successfully handles:
- Prefixing unused variables with underscore on pre-commit
- Running ESLint auto-fixes on pre-commit
- Blocking push with critical errors

## Next Steps

1. Fix the remaining parsing errors one by one
2. Run the specific fix scripts:
   ```
   npm run lint:unused-vars
   npm run lint:any
   ```
3. Address the empty object type issue in routes.ts
4. Implement a script to replace HTML img tags with Next.js Image component
5. Fix React hook dependency issues

## Time Estimate

Estimated time to fix all issues: ~5-8 hours of dedicated work
