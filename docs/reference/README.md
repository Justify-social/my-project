# Reference

This section contains technical reference material for the project. These documents provide detailed specifications and usage information rather than step-by-step guides.

## Available References

- **[Scripts](./scripts/index.md)**: Detailed documentation of available scripts in the project
- **[Linting](./configs/linting-guide.md)**: Linting rules and configuration guidance
- **[Icon System](./icons/icon-system.md)**: Icon system specification and usage
- **[API](./api/)**: API endpoints and specifications

## How to Use References

Reference documents are designed for lookup rather than reading from start to finish. Use them when you need:

1. Specific technical details 
2. Configuration options
3. Available parameters
4. Expected behaviours or responses

## Keeping References Updated

Reference documentation should be updated whenever related code changes. When updating reference material:

1. Be precise and concise
2. Include examples where helpful
3. Document edge cases and limitations
4. Cross-link to related documentation
