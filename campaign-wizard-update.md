## 3. Updates to `Step1Content.tsx`

`Step1Content.tsx` is the entry point of the Campaign Wizard, responsible for collecting foundational campaign information. The following updates have been made or are recommended to ensure its functionality and integration with the broader system:

1. **Type Mismatch Resolution**:

   - **Issue Identified**: A linter error at line 1266 indicated a type mismatch between the `FormValues` interface and the resolved type from the `Zod` schema in `useForm`. Specifically, `totalBudget` and `socialMediaBudget` were defined as `number | string` in `FormValues`, conflicting with the `Zod` schema's transformation to `number`.
   - **Action Taken**: Updated the `FormValues` interface at lines 78-79 to strictly type `totalBudget` and `socialMediaBudget` as `number`. This change aligns the interface with the schema, resolving the type error and ensuring type safety during form submission and validation.
   - **Code Reference**:
     ```typescript
     totalBudget: number;
     socialMediaBudget: number;
     ```
   - **Impact**: This fix prevents runtime errors during form processing and ensures that budget calculations are performed with consistent numeric values.

2. **Autosave Implementation**:

   - **Issue Identified**: The absence of an autosave feature risked data loss if users navigated away or experienced interruptions during form completion.
   - **Action Recommended**: Implement a `useEffect` hook to periodically save form data as a draft every 30 seconds, provided there are no validation errors. This feature enhances user experience by safeguarding their input.
   - **Code Reference**:
     ```typescript
     useEffect(() => {
       const interval = setInterval(() => {
         if (Object.keys(useFormErrors).length === 0) {
           handleSaveDraft(getValues());
           toast.success('Draft autosaved');
         }
       }, 30000); // Autosave every 30 seconds
       return () => clearInterval(interval);
     }, [useFormErrors, getValues]);
     ```
   - **Impact**: Autosave reduces user frustration by preserving progress, with a toast notification providing feedback on successful saves. It integrates with the existing `handleSaveDraft` function to maintain consistency with manual draft saving.

3. **Formik to React Hook Form Transition**:

   - **Issue Identified**: Remnants of Formik, such as `formikRef` at line 1187 and related logic in `useEffect` at lines 1189-1231, were present despite the transition to `React Hook Form`, causing potential confusion and code bloat.
   - **Action Recommended**: Remove `formikRef` declaration and update the `useEffect` block to directly use `setValue` from `React Hook Form` for populating form data from context. This completes the migration to a modern form management library.
   - **Code Reference**:
     ```typescript
     useEffect(() => {
       if (contextCampaignData) {
         console.log(
           '[Step1Content useEffect] Populating form with context data:',
           contextCampaignData
         );
         // ... (safely get contacts and influencers logic)
         // Format data for setting form values
         setValue(
           'name',
           contextCampaignData.name || contextCampaignData.campaignName || defaultFormValues.name
         );
         // ... (other setValue calls for form fields)
       }
     }, [contextCampaignData, setValue]);
     ```
   - **Impact**: This transition eliminates legacy code, reduces technical debt, and leverages the performance and simplicity of `React Hook Form` for better form state management.

4. **Logical Error Fix in InfluencerList**:

   - **Issue Identified**: The `InfluencerList` component incorrectly updated `additionalContacts` instead of `influencers` when adding a new influencer at line 1027, leading to incorrect data handling.
   - **Action Recommended**: Correct the `onClick` handler to append a new influencer object using the `append` function from `useFieldArray`.
   - **Code Reference**:
     ```typescript
     onClick={() => {
       append({ platform: '', handle: '' });
     }}
     ```
   - **Impact**: This fix ensures that new influencers are added to the correct form field array, maintaining data integrity and user expectations.

5. **Validation Workarounds for Zod Schema**:

   - **Issue Identified**: The `refine` methods for `endDate` and `socialMediaBudget` in the `Zod` schema (lines 299 and 305) were set to return `true` as a workaround, bypassing critical validation checks for date order and budget limits.
   - **Action Recommended**: Since direct access to `getValues()` is unavailable in the schema definition outside the component, add custom validation logic in the `handleSubmit` function before API submission to enforce these rules.
   - **Code Reference**:
     ```typescript
     // Custom validation for endDate and socialMediaBudget
     if (
       values.startDate &&
       values.endDate &&
       new Date(values.endDate) <= new Date(values.startDate)
     ) {
       setError('End date must be after start date');
       toast.error('End date must be after start date');
       setIsSubmitting(false);
       return;
     }
     if (
       values.totalBudget &&
       values.socialMediaBudget &&
       Number(values.socialMediaBudget) > Number(values.totalBudget)
     ) {
       setError('Social media budget cannot exceed total budget');
       toast.error('Social media budget cannot exceed total budget');
       setIsSubmitting(false);
       return;
     }
     ```
   - **Impact**: This workaround ensures that critical business rules are enforced at submission time, preventing invalid data from reaching the backend until a more elegant schema-based solution is devised.

6. **Shadcn UI Integration**:

   - **Issue Identified**: Custom UI components like `StyledField` and inline-styled buttons in `Step1Content.tsx` did not align with the Shadcn UI design system, risking inconsistency in the application's look and feel.
   - **Action Recommended**: Replace custom components with Shadcn UI primitives such as `Input`, `Select`, `Textarea`, and `Button` from the `ui` directory. Update imports and rewrite component usage to leverage these standardized elements.
   - **Code Reference** (Imports and `StyledField` rewrite):

     ```typescript
     import { Input } from '@/components/ui/input';
     import { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '@/components/ui/select';
     import { Textarea } from '@/components/ui/textarea';
     import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

     const StyledField = ({
       label,
       name,
       type = "text",
       as,
       children,
       required = false,
       icon,
       control,
       errors,
       ...props
     }: any) => {
       return <div className="mb-5 font-work-sans">
         <label htmlFor={name} className="block text-sm font-medium text-foreground mb-2 font-work-sans">
           {label}
           {required && <span className="text-accent ml-1 font-work-sans">*</span>}
         </label>
         <div className="relative font-work-sans">
           {icon && <div className="absolute left-3 top-0 bottom-0 flex items-center justify-center text-muted-foreground form-icon-container font-work-sans">
             {icon}
           </div>}
           <Controller
             name={name}
             control={control}
             render={({ field }) => (
               as === 'textarea' ? (
                 <Textarea
                   id={name}
                   {...field}
                   className={`w-full p-2.5 ${icon ? 'pl-10' : 'pl-3'} border border-input rounded-md focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring focus:border-ring focus:outline-none transition-colors duration-200 shadow-sm bg-background font-work-sans`}
                   {...props}
                 />
               ) : as === 'select' ? (
                 <Select {...field} onValueChange={field.onChange}>
                   <SelectTrigger className={`w-full h-10 p-2.5 ${icon ? 'pl-10' : 'pl-3'} border border-input rounded-md focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring focus:border-ring focus:outline-none transition-colors duration-200 shadow-sm bg-background font-work-sans`}>
                     <SelectValue placeholder="Select an option" />
                   </SelectTrigger>
                   <SelectContent>
                     {children.props.children.map((child: any) => (
                       <SelectItem key={child.props.value} value={child.props.value}>
                         {child.props.children}
                       </SelectItem>
                     ))}
                   </SelectContent>
                 </Select>
               ) : (
                 <Input
                   type={type}
                   id={name}
                   {...field}
                   className={`w-full h-10 p-2.5 ${icon ? 'pl-10' : 'pl-3'} border border-input rounded-md focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring focus:border-ring focus:outline-none transition-colors duration-200 shadow-sm bg-background font-work-sans`}
                   {...props}
                 />
               )
             )}
           />
           // ... (icon handling for date and select)
         </div>
         {errors[name] && <p className="mt-1 text-sm text-destructive font-work-sans">{errors[name]?.message}</p>}
       </div>;
     };
     ```

   - **Code Reference** (Button update in `InfluencerList`):
     ```typescript
     <Button type="button" variant="outline" onClick={() => append({ platform: '', handle: '' })} className="mt-3 flex items-center text-[var(--primary-color)] hover:text-[var(--accent-color)] font-work-sans">
       <Icon iconId="faPlusLight" className="h-5 w-5 mr-2" />

## 4. Comprehensive Review of Campaign Wizard Components

The Campaign Wizard is a multi-step workflow designed to streamline the creation of marketing campaigns. Below is an exhaustive review of its architecture, individual steps, and supporting components, based on an analysis of files in the `src/components/features/campaigns` directory. This section aims to provide a complete understanding of the wizard's structure, identify areas for improvement, and recommend actionable steps to enhance functionality and maintainability.

### 4.1 Overview of Campaign Wizard Architecture

The Campaign Wizard is built on a modular architecture that separates concerns between state management, navigation, UI rendering, and error handling. This design facilitates extensibility and allows for independent updates to specific components without affecting the entire system. Key architectural components include:

- **WizardContext.tsx** (394 lines):

  - **Purpose**: Acts as the central state management hub for the Campaign Wizard, providing a shared context for data across all steps. It encapsulates campaign data, loading states, and functions for updating or reloading data from the backend.
  - **Key Features**: Includes context provider setup, state initialization, data fetching logic, and update mechanisms. It serves as the backbone for maintaining SSOT by ensuring all steps access and modify the same data source.
  - **Observations**: The file's length suggests a complex state management system, possibly handling API interactions, data transformation, and error states. It's critical to ensure this context is optimized for performance to avoid unnecessary re-renders across steps.
  - **Recommendations**: Review for potential memoization of context values to prevent performance bottlenecks. Consider documenting the context API for easier consumption by step components. Ensure error handling for API calls is robust to prevent state inconsistencies.

- **WizardNavigation.tsx** (155 lines):

  - **Purpose**: Manages navigation logic between wizard steps, providing a consistent mechanism for users to move forward, backward, or skip steps as allowed by the workflow.
  - **Key Features**: Implements navigation controls, likely including buttons or links with event handlers that update the current step in the context or via routing.
  - **Observations**: This component is moderately sized, indicating a focused responsibility. It likely interacts with `WizardContext.tsx` or a routing library (e.g., Next.js `useRouter`) to manage step transitions.
  - **Recommendations**: Ensure navigation logic respects form validation states (e.g., preventing progression if required fields are incomplete). Add accessibility features like ARIA labels for navigation controls. Consider adding confirmation dialogs for skipping steps to prevent accidental data loss.

- **ProgressBar.tsx** (218 lines):

  - **Purpose**: Visually represents the user's progress through the wizard steps, enhancing UX by providing a clear indication of completion status and navigation options.
  - **Key Features**: Renders a progress indicator (likely a bar or step icons), supports step-click navigation, and includes action buttons for saving drafts, moving back, or proceeding. It integrates with state to reflect the current step and validation status.
  - **Observations**: The file size suggests additional logic beyond simple rendering, possibly including state checks for button enablement/disablement and toast notifications for save actions.
  - **Recommendations**: Ensure the progress bar is responsive and accessible, with clear visual cues for completed, current, and upcoming steps. Verify that button states (e.g., disabled/enabled) accurately reflect form validity to prevent user errors. Consider adding tooltips or labels for step navigation on hover for better UX.

- **StepContentLoader.tsx** (67 lines):

  - **Purpose**: Dynamically loads and renders the appropriate step component based on the current step in the wizard, acting as a content switcher.
  - **Key Features**: Likely uses a switch or conditional rendering based on a step identifier from context or props to load the correct step component (e.g., `Step1Content.tsx`).
  - **Observations**: Its brevity indicates a straightforward responsibility, focusing solely on rendering the correct step without additional logic.
  - **Recommendations**: Ensure lazy loading or suspense is used for step components to optimize initial load performance. Add error boundaries around step rendering to isolate failures. Document the mapping of step identifiers to components for clarity.

- **ErrorBoundary.tsx** (42 lines):

  - **Purpose**: Provides error handling for the wizard components, catching JavaScript errors in child components to prevent complete UI crashes and display fallback content.
  - **Key Features**: Implements React's `componentDidCatch` or similar error boundary logic to log errors and render a user-friendly error message or fallback UI.
  - **Observations**: The small file size suggests a focused utility component with minimal complexity.
  - **Recommendations**: Ensure error logging integrates with a monitoring system (e.g., Sentry) for production environments. Provide a user-friendly fallback UI with a retry or support contact option. Test boundary behavior with various error scenarios to confirm robustness.

- **types.ts** (73 lines):
  - **Purpose**: Defines TypeScript types and interfaces used across the wizard components, ensuring type safety for form data, context state, and component props.
  - **Key Features**: Includes type definitions for campaign data structures, form values, and possibly API response shapes.
  - **Observations**: A concise file focused on type definitions, critical for maintaining code quality in a TypeScript environment.
  - **Recommendations**: Regularly review and update types to reflect any changes in data structures or API contracts. Consider centralizing shared types in a global `types` directory if they are used beyond the wizard. Add JSDoc comments to complex types for better IDE support and developer understanding.

### 4.2 Campaign Wizard Steps

The Campaign Wizard consists of five distinct steps, each represented by a dedicated component responsible for collecting specific aspects of campaign data. Below is a detailed analysis of each step, including file size, inferred purpose, identified issues, and specific recommendations for improvement.

- **Step1Content.tsx** (0 lines in current view, but known to be extensive based on backup `Step1Content copy.tsx` at 1478 lines):

  - **Purpose**: Serves as the initial step of the Campaign Wizard, focusing on collecting foundational campaign information such as name, business goals, dates, contacts, influencers, and budget details.
  - **Key Features**: Implements a complex form with multiple sections for campaign metadata, contact information (primary, secondary, additional), influencer selection with validation, and budget inputs with currency selection. It integrates with `React Hook Form` for state management and `Zod` for validation.
  - **Identified Issues**:
    - **Type Mismatches**: Linter error at line 1266 due to `totalBudget` and `socialMediaBudget` being typed as `number | string` in `FormValues` while `Zod` schema expects `number`.
    - **Formik Remnants**: Legacy code like `formikRef` (line 1187) and related `useEffect` logic (lines 1189-1231) remain despite migration to `React Hook Form`.
    - **Logical Error**: `InfluencerList` component incorrectly updates `additionalContacts` instead of `influencers` (line 1027).
    - **Validation Workarounds**: `Zod` `refine` methods for `endDate` and `socialMediaBudget` return `true` as a placeholder, bypassing critical checks (lines 299, 305).

Ensure performance optimization if providing large state trees.
  - **Impact**: Clear delineation of context responsibilities prevents state conflicts and ensures maintainable architecture.

### 4.4 Key Observations and Recommendations

After a thorough review of the Campaign Wizard components, several overarching observations and strategic recommendations emerge to guide the update project and future development:

- **Consistency Across Steps**:

  - **Observation**: Variability in form management libraries (e.g., Formik vs. `React Hook Form`), UI styling (custom vs. Shadcn UI), and feature implementation (e.g., autosave presence) across steps risks inconsistent user experience and maintainability challenges.
  - **Recommendation**: Standardize all steps to use `React Hook Form` for form management, `Zod` for validation, and Shadcn UI components for rendering. Use Step 1's updates as a blueprint for refactoring Steps 2-5, ensuring uniform architecture, error handling, and UX patterns. Create a checklist for each step to verify compliance with these standards during updates.

- **Autosave Implementation**:

  - **Observation**: Autosave is not universally implemented, leaving user data vulnerable to loss in longer steps or during unexpected interruptions.
  - **Recommendation**: Implement autosave functionality across all steps using a consistent `useEffect` hook pattern, triggered every 30 seconds if form data is valid. Integrate with `AutosaveIndicator.tsx` for visual feedback and toast notifications for confirmation. Ensure autosave respects API rate limits or backend load by batching updates or implementing debouncing if frequent saves are detected. Document autosave behavior in a central README or within each step's comments for transparency.

- **Shadcn UI Integration**:

  - **Observation**: Many components use custom or inline styling, diverging from the application's design system and risking visual inconsistency or accessibility issues.
  - **Recommendation**: Replace all custom UI elements with Shadcn UI components (`Input`, `Select`, `Textarea`, `Button`, etc.) across the wizard. For components not directly covered by Shadcn UI (e.g., custom sliders), extend or style existing components to match the design system. Establish a UI review process to ensure new additions adhere to Shadcn UI guidelines. Update CSS variables or themes to use brand colors (e.g., Jet #333333, Deep Sky Blue #00BFFF) as defined in project standards for cohesive branding.

- **Type Safety and Validation**:

  - **Observation**: Type mismatches (as seen in Step 1) and potential validation gaps across steps could lead to runtime errors or invalid data submission, impacting campaign integrity.
  - **Recommendation**: Enforce strict type safety by aligning all form data with TypeScript interfaces in `types.ts`. Review and expand `Zod` schemas for each step to cover all input fields, implementing custom validation where schema limitations exist (e.g., cross-field validation in `handleSubmit`). Add unit tests for validation logic to catch edge cases. Document type and validation requirements for each data field to guide future updates.

- **Performance Optimization**:

  - **Observation**: Large files like `Step5Content.tsx` (2360 lines) and potentially complex components (e.g., `CampaignAssetUploader.tsx`) pose risks of slow rendering or memory issues, especially in data-heavy steps.
  - **Recommendation**: Implement lazy loading or React's `Suspense` for heavy components or steps to defer rendering until necessary. Split monolithic components into smaller, focused sub-components with clear responsibilities (e.g., separate UI, logic, and data fetching). Use memoization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`) to prevent unnecessary re-renders, especially in context-heavy components like `WizardContext.tsx`. Profile performance with tools like React Developer Tools to identify bottlenecks. Document performance benchmarks and optimization strategies for large components.

- **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer**:
  - **Observation**: Current documentation within codebases varies, with some components lacking clear purpose or usage comments, hindering onboarding and maintenance.
  - **Recommendation**: Establish a documentation standard requiring JSDoc comments for all components, functions, and complex logic blocks. Create or update a `README.md` in the `campaigns` directory to outline the wizard's architecture, step purposes, data flow, and integration points. Add inline comments for critical logic or workarounds (e.g., `Zod` validation bypasses). Maintain this `campaign-wizard-update.md` as a living document, updated with each major change or review. Consider a wiki or Confluence page for non-technical stakeholders summarizing wizard functionality and update status.

## 5. Future Considerations and Roadmap

To ensure the Campaign Wizard remains a robust, scalable feature, several future considerations and a strategic roadmap are proposed. These address long-term maintainability, user experience enhancements, and technical debt reduction:

- **Component Modularization and Reusability**:

  - **Consideration**: Custom components like `StyledField`, `DateRangePicker`, and audience selectors are currently embedded in specific steps but could be reusable across the application.
  - **Roadmap Action**: Identify and extract reusable UI components to `src/components/ui` or a shared `common` directory after updating to Shadcn UI standards. Create a component library documentation or Storybook instance to showcase usage, props, and variants. Target completion within the next 3-6 months post-wizard update to prevent code duplication in other features.

- **Advanced Validation with Zod**:

  - **Consideration**: Current workarounds for `Zod` schema validation (e.g., bypassing `refine` checks) are temporary and risk data integrity if not addressed systematically.
  - **Roadmap Action**: Research and implement solutions for cross-field validation in `Zod`, potentially using context passing or custom validators. Explore integrating validation libraries or patterns that support complex dependencies if `Zod` limitations persist. Schedule a dedicated sprint within 2 months to refactor validation across all steps, ensuring robust data checks without submission-time hacks.

- **End-to-End Testing and User Feedback**:

  - **Consideration**: Current updates focus on code-level fixes, but lack comprehensive testing or user feedback to validate UX and functionality improvements.
  - **Roadmap Action**: Develop end-to-end (E2E) tests using tools like Cypress or Playwright to simulate user journeys through the wizard, covering data entry, navigation, autosave, and submission. Conduct user testing sessions with marketing teams to gather feedback on usability, clarity, and pain points. Plan for an initial E2E test suite within 1 month post-update, with user testing scheduled quarterly to inform iterative improvements.

- **Performance Monitoring and Optimization**:

  - **Consideration**: Large components like `Step5Content.tsx` and potential API-heavy operations (e.g., asset uploads, influencer validation) could degrade performance over time, especially with increased user data.
  - **Roadmap Action**: Integrate performance monitoring with tools like Lighthouse or custom metrics in production to track load times and interaction delays. Prioritize optimization of identified bottlenecks (e.g., lazy loading for Step 5, caching for API calls) in a dedicated performance sprint within 3 months. Establish performance benchmarks (e.g., <2s step load time) to guide future development.

- **Feature Expansion and Integration**:

  - **Consideration**: The Campaign Wizard could benefit from additional features like templates, AI-driven suggestions for targeting, or integration with analytics platforms for real-time campaign insights.
  - **Roadmap Action**: Gather stakeholder input to prioritize feature requests for the wizard (e.g., campaign templates, predictive audience targeting). Plan a feature discovery phase within 6 months to scope and prototype enhancements. Explore API integrations with analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, internal dashboards) to provide data-driven insights during campaign setup, targeting a beta release of integrations within 9-12 months.

- **Accessibility Compliance**:
  - **Consideration**: Current components may not fully meet accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1), risking exclusion of users with disabilities and potential legal compliance issues.
  - **Roadmap Action**: Conduct an accessibility audit using tools like axe-core to identify gaps in ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and color contrast across wizard components. Schedule remediation within 2-3 months post-update, prioritizing high-impact fixes (e.g., form field labels, focus management). Train the development team on accessibility best practices to ensure future updates maintain compliance.

## 6. SSOT Alignment and Architectural Principles

The Campaign Wizard update project adheres to the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) principle by ensuring that all components access and modify a unified data source via `WizardContext.tsx`, preventing data fragmentation or inconsistency. Key alignment strategies include:

- **Centralized State Management**: `WizardContext.tsx` serves as the authoritative data store, with all steps reading from and writing to this context to maintain a single, consistent campaign data object throughout the wizard flow.
- **Type Consistency**: TypeScript interfaces in `types.ts` and `Zod` schemas enforce a uniform data structure, preventing type-related errors and ensuring data integrity from input to submission.
- **Standardized UI Components**: Integration with Shadcn UI components ensures a consistent visual and interactive language across the wizard, reducing user learning curves and development overhead for custom styling.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: This document and inline code comments provide a single reference point for understanding the wizard's architecture, updates, and future plans, minimizing knowledge silos and facilitating team collaboration.

Architecturally, the wizard follows a modular design with separation of concerns (state, UI, navigation, error handling), enabling independent updates and scalability. Updates prioritize simplicity (e.g., removing legacy Formik code), robustness (e.g., autosave, validation), and user-centric design (e.g., Shadcn UI, feedback mechanisms), aligning with MIT-level precision and surgical clarity in engineering quality.

## 7. Backup Strategy and Workflow Safety

To safeguard the integrity of the original codebase during the update process, a rigorous backup strategy is implemented as part of the project workflow:

- **Backup Creation**: Before any modifications are made to a file, a backup copy is created with a suffix (e.g., `Step1Content_backup.tsx`) and stored in the same directory as the original file. This ensures that the original state is preserved in case of unintended changes or errors.
- **Backup Management**: A list of all backup files is maintained within this documentation or a separate tracking document to ensure visibility and accountability. Each backup is timestamped or versioned if multiple backups are created over time.
- **Backup Removal**: At the final step of the project, once all updates are reviewed, tested, and approved, all backup files will be manually removed to maintain a clean codebase. This step will be documented with a confirmation of successful update deployment to ensure no original data is lost prematurely.
- **Implementation**: Since automated file operations are restricted, developers are responsible for manually creating and removing backups. Guidance for scripting this process locally (e.g., using shell commands like `cp` for copying and `rm` for removal) can be provided if needed. For example:

  ```bash
  # Create backup
  cp src/components/features/campaigns/Step1Content.tsx src/components/features/campaigns/Step1Content_backup_$(date +%F).tsx

  # Remove backup at project end (after confirmation)
  rm src/components/features/campaigns/Step1Content_backup_*.tsx
  ```
````

- **Impact**: This strategy mitigates risk during development, providing a safety net for rollback if updates introduce issues, while ensuring a tidy repository upon project completion.

     - **Ticket 11 (New): Implement Campaign Wizard Autosave**
        - **Title:** Implement Autosave Functionality in Campaign Wizard
        - **Priority:** P2 (New Task)
        - **File(s):** Primarily within `WizardProvider` (`WizardContext.tsx`) and individual step components (`Step*.tsx`).
        - **Description:** To improve user experience and prevent data loss, an autosave mechanism should be implemented for the campaign wizard. Changes should be saved automatically in the background after a short delay following user input, in addition to the manual "Save Draft" button.
        - **Goal:** Automatically save draft progress as the user fills out the wizard forms.
        - **Acceptance Criteria:**
          - Modify `WizardProvider` or relevant context to include autosave logic (e.g., using `useEffect` with debouncing on form data changes).
          - Trigger the existing `handleSaveDraft` function (or a similar background save mechanism) automatically after a defined debounce period (e.g., 2-3 seconds) when form values change (`isDirty` state can be useful here).
          - Ensure autosave only triggers if there are actual changes (`isDirty`).
          - Provide subtle visual feedback during/after autosave (e.g., updating the "Last saved" time in `ProgressBar` more frequently, potentially a brief "Saving..." indicator).
          - Ensure autosave does not interfere with manual saving or final submission.
          - Test thoroughly across different input types and steps.
