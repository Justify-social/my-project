- âœ… Test save functionality with various input combinations
- âœ… Ensure all form fields are properly mapped to database fields

### 5. Additional Contacts Feature
- âœ… Modifying Step 1 UI to support variable number of contacts
- âœ… Update database schema if needed to support multiple contacts
- âœ… Implement add/remove functionality for contact entries
- âœ… Ensure backend API can handle multiple contacts

### 6. Robustness Enhancements
- âœ… Add form state preservation between sessions
- âœ… Implement comprehensive error recovery
- Add progress indicators showing completion status across steps
- Create a "review all" option before final submission
- Add data export functionality
- Implement a wizard recovery system in case of unexpected errors
- Add analytics to track user progression and drop-off points

## Implementation Order
1. âœ… Verify data saving (especially Step 4) as the highest priority
2. âœ… Add autosave functionality
3. âœ… Implement additional contacts feature
4. ðŸ”„ API verification (In Progress)
5. UI brand alignment
6. Additional robustness enhancements

## Data Persistence Fix Plan - Schema-Aware Steps

After analyzing Campaign ID 13 data and reviewing our Prisma schema, we identified and fixed systematic issues with data persistence across relational tables. All of these steps have now been completed:

### âœ… STEP 1: Map Database Schema to Form Fields
- âœ… Created complete field mapping between wizard forms and database tables
- âœ… Identified and fixed gaps in field mapping that caused data loss
- âœ… Documented required vs. optional fields based on schema

### âœ… STEP 2: Update Main Campaign PATCH Endpoint
- âœ… Updated updateData object to match CampaignWizardSubmission schema
- âœ… Added comprehensive logging before and after database operations
- âœ… Implemented proper error handling with specific error messages

### âœ… STEP 3: Implement Prisma Transaction-Based Updates
- âœ… Modified database update logic to use transactions
- âœ… Implemented proper handling of all related tables within transactions
- âœ… Added safety checks to prevent partial updates

### âœ… STEP 4: Create Step-Specific API Endpoints
- âœ… Created dedicated endpoints for step-specific data
- âœ… Implemented proper mapping between form fields and database fields
- âœ… Added transaction support for relational data

### âœ… STEP 5: Implement Schema-Based Validation
- âœ… Created validation logic that matches database schema requirements
- âœ… Implemented comprehensive validation for all form inputs
- âœ… Added helpful error messages for validation failures

### âœ… STEP 6: Update WizardContext with Schema-Aware Formatting
- âœ… Modified form data handlers to properly format data for schema
- âœ… Updated step-specific data formatting for each wizard step
- âœ… Added type safety throughout the wizard context

### âœ… STEP 7: Fix Form Submit Handlers
- âœ… Updated each step's submission logic
- âœ… Ensured proper data formatting for database schema
- âœ… Added appropriate error handling and user feedback

### âœ… STEP 8: Add Database Diagnostic Logging
- âœ… Implemented detailed logging focused on data persistence
- âœ… Added tracking for success/failure with specific error details
- âœ… Created utility for viewing logs by campaign ID

### âœ… STEP 9: Handle Data Recovery
- âœ… Implemented data recovery mechanisms for incomplete submissions
- âœ… Added ability to resume from any step
- âœ… Created utilities for data verification

### âœ… STEP 10: Implement Comprehensive Testing
- âœ… Created test cases with sample data matching schema requirements
- âœ… Verified data integrity across all related tables
- âœ… Tested error handling and recovery mechanisms

All success criteria have been met:
- âœ… Zero null/missing values in required schema fields
- âœ… Proper relational integrity between all linked tables
- âœ… Consistent data types matching schema definitions
- âœ… Successful validation against schema constraints
- âœ… Full data recovery capability for incomplete submissions
