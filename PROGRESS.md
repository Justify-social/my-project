# Campaign Wizard Enhancement Plan

## Goals
1. Make the Campaign Wizard more on-brand with global.css
2. Add autosave feature / Implement data persistence improvements
3. Verify external APIs are working effectively
4. Ensure data is being correctly saved at every step (especially step 4)
5. Add options for additional contacts on Step 1
6. Make the wizard more robust with additional enhancements

## Plan of Attack

### 1. UI Brand Alignment
- Review `global.css` to identify brand colors, typography, and styling patterns
- Update each step component to ensure consistent use of brand styling
- Review components for responsive behavior and accessibility
- Focus on consistency across all wizard steps

### 2. Autosave & Data Persistence
- âœ… Implement a debounced autosave function that triggers after user interaction pauses
- âœ… Add a last saved indicator to show users when their progress was last saved
- âœ… Implement browser storage (localStorage/sessionStorage) as a backup for form data
- âœ… Ensure clean recovery if user navigates away and returns
- âœ… Add ability to resume from last saved step

### 3. API Integration Verification
- Test the IP Geolocation API integration for timezone detection
- Verify Exchange Rates API functionality for currency conversion

- Ensure all APIs have proper error handling and fallbacks

### 4. Data Saving Verification
- âœ… Review Step 4 implementation to identify potential saving issues
- âœ… Add comprehensive logging for save operations
- âœ… Implement validation to ensure data integrity at each step
- âœ… Test save functionality with various input combinations

- âœ… Update database schema if needed to support multiple contacts
- âœ… Implement add/remove functionality for contact entries

### 6. Robustness Enhancements
- âœ… Add form state preservation between sessions
- âœ… Implement comprehensive error recovery
- Add progress indicators showing completion status across steps
- Create a "review all" option before final submission
- Add data export functionality
