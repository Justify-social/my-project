# Brand Lift Implementation Progress

## Recent Improvements

- **Real Data Integration**: Replaced mock data with real database data for Survey Preview page, with robust fallbacks in case of API failures.
- **Modular Data Mapping**: Created reusable utility functions for mapping campaign data to survey format, improving code maintainability.
- **Robust Date Handling**: Added comprehensive date format handling to safely process dates regardless of their format (string, Date object, or other), preventing runtime errors.
- **Enum Handling**: Fixed issues with Prisma enum handling by using string literals with type assertions instead of direct enum references, improving type safety and data validation.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced duplicate code and improved error handling throughout the application.
- **UI Enhancements**: Implemented the `CreativePreview` component for consistent creative asset rendering across the application.
