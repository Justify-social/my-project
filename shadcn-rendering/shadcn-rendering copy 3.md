# Shadcn Component Path Resolution Fix

## Issue Resolved
We encountered module resolution errors for components that had been removed or relocated:

```
Uncaught Error: Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/ui/atoms/calendar/Calendar'
```

Similar errors occurred for the Card component.

## Root Cause
- Component files in `/atoms/calendar/Calendar` and `/atoms/card/Card` were permanently removed from the codebase due to duplication
- These components were relocated to the organisms directory, but the path mappings weren't updated
- The SHADCN_PATH_MAP still pointed to the old locations
- The COMPONENT_IMPORTS still attempted to import from the non-existent paths

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated SHADCN_PATH_MAP
Modified path mappings to point to the correct locations:
```javascript
export const SHADCN_PATH_MAP = {
  // ...
  '@/components/ui/calendar': '@/components/ui/organisms/calendar/Calendar', // Updated from atoms
  '@/components/ui/card': '@/components/ui/organisms/card/Card', // Updated from atoms
  // ...
};
```

### 2. Removed Non-existent Component Imports
Removed references to components that no longer exist:
```javascript
export const COMPONENT_IMPORTS = {
  // Removed:
  // '@/components/ui/atoms/calendar/Calendar': () => import('@/components/ui/atoms/calendar/Calendar'),
  // '@/components/ui/atoms/card/Card': () => import('@/components/ui/atoms/card/Card'),
  
  // Other components remain unchanged
};
```

### 3. Enhanced safeDynamicImport for Legacy Support
Added fallback logic to handle any remaining references to the old paths:
```javascript
if (!importFn) {
  // If the original mapping doesn't exist, check if there's an alternative mapping
  if (resolvedPath.includes('/atoms/calendar/')) {
    console.info(`Remapping deprecated calendar path to organisms version`);
    return COMPONENT_IMPORTS['@/components/ui/organisms/calendar/Calendar']();
  }
  
  if (resolvedPath.includes('/atoms/card/')) {
    console.info(`Remapping deprecated card path to organisms version`);
    return COMPONENT_IMPORTS['@/components/ui/organisms/card/Card']();
  }
  // ...
}
```

## Benefits of This Approach
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Maintains SSOT by centralizing path mapping logic
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Provides graceful degradation for any code still referencing old paths
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Better logging and fallbacks for component resolution
4. **Clean Implementation**: No need for virtual or duplicate components

## Verification
- Server properly starts without module resolution errors
- UI Components debug page loads correctly 
- All Shadcn components are properly displayed and importable

This fix ensures that the component registry correctly handles the organizational changes in the codebase while maintaining backward compatibility with any code that might still reference the old paths.
