Using Graphitis MCP Tools

Before Starting Any Task
REQUIRED: Always check Graphiti before starting ANY task
Use mcp_Graphiti_search_nodes to find existing preferences procedures or facts relevant to the task
Use mcp_Graphiti_search_facts to uncover relationships or relevant factual data
Filter by entity type when searching (e.g., "Preference" or "Procedure")
Always review all matches before taking any action
Follow existing procedures and preferences exactly

Capture Work Immediately
Use mcp_Graphiti_add_episode (keep to less than 10 words where you can) to capture preferences procedures and facts as soon as they come up
Break long preferences into clear logical chunks
Be explicit when something updates existing knowledge
Label all entries with specific categories for better recall

Align with Whats Known
Follow existing preferences and procedures exactly
Support your decisions with stored facts
Avoid guesswork or hallucination - stick to whats known

Use Memory Effectively
Provide memory based suggestions when relevant
Keep memory updated - remove outdated preferences or procedures
Make sure every preference or procedure mentioned is in memory
Show users what is in memory when helpful

VERIFICATION: After every task, confirm knowledge has been properly stored
